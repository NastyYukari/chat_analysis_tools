1:03:39 | knowsur: いーあるふぁんくらぶ
1:03:45 | パナナナダ: what is your favoruite vtuber cover of roki?
1:03:58 | Arcterion: 'Otaku' is the same as 'weeb', tbh. Some folks still use it as an insult, but the weebs themselves have embraced it.
1:04:00 | Vic Kyorlo: roki's from 2018 but that's still recent
1:04:13 | webm aristocrat: Roki is pretty good
1:04:31 | Sunspots: zoomer song, bear doesnt remember
1:04:32 | webm aristocrat: weeb is a contraction of weeaboo

1:06:16 | knowsur: いーあるふぁんくぶ was composed by みきとP!

1:06:19 | sleepy: ayylmao 
1:06:21 | Zhnigo: utsu-p is amazing, too bad he'll never be in project diva games
1:06:22 | Vic Kyorlo: mitchie-m is really great too
1:06:25 | Moon Runes: based roku vulovic 👍
1:06:28 | Hanabi: @Shippo that's Wapanese, Weeb is short for weeaboo which is a nonsense word
1:07:16 | Hanabi: I played a lot of Project Diva back in the day
1:07:19 | Destoroyar Fortress: Because otaku...
1:07:19 | Vic Kyorlo: because there's a lot of variety and a lot of it is very honest
1:07:25 | .sandrio: and wapanese was wordfiltered to weeaboo which then got sohrtened to weeb and there we are
1:07:36 | Vic Kyorlo: it's made "from the heart", kind of
1:07:37 | Sunspots: i dont like it much, honestly i kind of managed to avoid it completely until vtubers consumed my life
1:07:43 | imalittle cupcake: I got stuck listening to Triple Baka on Youtube and bought Project Diva later
1:07:45 | Zhnigo: vocaloid is the same kind of anime bleeding into reality as vtubing
1:07:49 | ThePlatinumCan: Vocal sounds unusual and there's huge variety of musical styles. Project Diva games are fun too.
1:07:55 | Chloro [クロロ]: I got to know a lot of vocalo songs from vtubers

1:56:16 | TheCanti: I can't believe our daughter is a hentai, someone needs to ground her from the computer
1:56:21 | Fake Name: Oh hello ma'am, your sneeze is quite cute!
1:56:40 | Meep: they say a sneeze is 1/8th of a orgasm.

2:07:49 | Xayn: 寝すぎた
2:07:58 | Oats 外: i get that too
2:07:59 | Nasty Yukari: I have that too. I have to check my teeth when I wake up to make sure they didn't actually fall out

2:09:54 | TheCanti: Don't be that lazy!
2:09:59 | Terra: lately I've been remembering a lot of dreams, but sometimes I don't
2:10:02 | Stray Wolf: maybe because they leave a strong impression
2:10:08 | Zhnigo: have you tried an electric toothbrush? makes brushing teeth less mendokusai
2:10:12 | Defenestrator: Keeping a dream journal helps me remember dreams
2:10:16 | 123457474869: I sometimes die in my dreams
2:10:38 | Vic Kyorlo: I haven't really been remembering my dreams since like middle school
2:10:49 | iDoujin: I only have nightmare after playing scary games
2:11:04 | imalittle cupcake: I used to dream about having a family but now I have a daughter so it's not longer a dream

2:11:19 | Voltage: sleepy bear?
2:11:20 | Nasty Yukari: I have a recurring dream where I get shot and die too
2:11:38 | Nasty Yukari: I wake up when I die in my dreams
2:11:39 | RueTobas: You wake up when you die usually
2:11:40 | Destoroyar Fortress: I wake up

2:12:04 | Bailing Baker: If you die in a dream, you die in real life
2:12:07 | Ark K.: you die in real life 😨
2:12:09 | thelastshinobi56: Dying in your dreams is a sign of good luck
2:12:10 | Defenestrator: You die in real life
2:12:11 | TWAIN: and very rarely dream of reincarnation
2:12:14 | TheCanti: That dream is another timeline
2:12:15 | Badilla: That's a junji ito story
2:12:23 | FBI SURVALENCE: maybe this is a dream we never woke up from
2:12:25 | Verijero: its like SAO
2:12:33 | パナナナダ: its a good way to die
2:12:37 | Monkberry Moon: you change pov
2:12:40 | パナナナダ: not painful at all
2:12:42 | Voltage: are we awake?
2:12:56 | Destoroyar Fortress: That one time when I slept too much and transported myself to an alternate reality where the demon lord was my mom
2:13:00 | Stray Wolf: if you die in that dream you died in that world and you get isekaied back 
2:13:11 | RueTobas: I really do not want to know what teeth taste like
2:13:16 | TheCanti: Very crunchy
2:13:17 | Fettuccine フェットチーネ: わからない
2:13:29 | 123457474869: Tastes like blood
2:13:33 | Balnus Panglord: I like getting Nightmares
2:13:39 | CommanderMichael: my dreams can be very random and silly, it's like my brain likes to create some silly fanfic at will
2:13:44 | TWAIN: my shortest dream lasted for 15 seconds or so, a dog chased me and jumped at my throat
2:13:50 | skrong: In dreams where my teeth fall out they don't taste like anything, just feels like gravel in my mouth
2:14:08 | パナナナダ: i dreamt of natsuri matsuri even though she's not my oshi
2:14:16 | パナナナダ: 夢は不思議だね
