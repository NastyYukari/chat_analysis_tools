14:00 | Noon C.: it's cutting here too?
14:03 | max r: Twitch is still live, and audio is still cutting
14:03 | HashSlash: How so Rye? I dont know twitch stats as well
14:04 | monkeynohito: Nice, please give her your stimmys
14:07 | Jackku Chan: Maybe it's tied to volume?
14:10 | thelastshinobi56: it's fine now I think
14:13 | Aggressive Quack: Its ok! it was worth a shot
14:15 | Jackku Chan: I feel like it cuts off when Beatani is quiet
14:37 | Mechanized Doge: まだつながっているよ
14:42 | Jackku Chan: Beatani is Tsundere towards Twitch!
14:43 | monkeynohito: The stream is fine, reload if you're having trouble
14:55 | max r: Twitch is live just the chat is removed.
14:57 | Noon C.: ok, seems fine
15:13 | Zeng: it seems better now
15:42 | Zhnigo: maybe restart the stream?
15:59 | Zhnigo: game audio is fine, but voice cuts out
16:40 | max r: 🔪Twitch bros
16:49 | Verijero: doesnt seem to be an internet problem but some setting
16:49 | thelastshinobi56: it's lag I think
16:50 | Spartanix13: i think it may be a mic threshold issue maybe
16:57 | Mechanized Doge: がんばれよ～
17:10 | Verijero: can you try turning up mic sensitivity?
17:10 | Shippo: yes, seems like a mic issue
17:23 | Vitz: おはだよ
17:29 | Jackku Chan: Beatani doesn't understand how little we hear uuu.
17:38 | クラガリ葉月: Maybe restart the mic?
17:58 | Stray Wolf: it's getting cut off
17:59 | Zhnigo: punished bea: a bear denied her voice
18:06 | Mechanized Doge: 😲
18:12 | SkysNotTheLimit: Did you change any microphone settings after last stream?
18:21 | (Verified, Moderator) Streamlabs: max just tipped $3.00 dayo!
18:23 | Mechanized Doge: ユーチューブは大丈夫そうだよ
18:25 | Stray Wolf: it's the mic port? 
18:25 | Nasty Yukari: It's naotta now
18:26 | max r: game audio = ok, mic audio = cutting
18:26 | Jackku Chan: Can you say some long sentences to see?
18:46 | Rye Mountain: I think you have the mic set up to stop recording when the audio is not loud. Try to find a way to have the mic always on.
19:06 | クラガリ葉月: Still fading in and out
19:08 | ChefHART: BASED BEAR
19:14 | Nasty Yukari: Ahh, it's still clipping the voice too much 😭
