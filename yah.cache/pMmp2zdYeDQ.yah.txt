51:56 | Ekusupuroshon: Fight! Kill!
51:59 | SkysNotTheLimit: Fight! Strong bear!
51:59 | HashSlash: Save Basil!!
52:07 | MiiMuu: beat him up!
52:11 | Akka Oni: Let's get used to fighting
52:15 | Aggressive Quack: kick his butt!
52:21 | Verijero: kefka was a good boss
52:24 | Ekusupuroshon: Violence yeah!!!
52:25 | Mags Durandal: You are right, he is pitiful.
52:40 | Mew: Awww he really pitiful 
53:13 | Alazur: Beatani uses Paw Slash
53:21 | max r: 🐾
53:27 | Verijero: foe = enemy
53:28 | Aggressive Quack: Benevolent Bear 👼
53:30 | Mew: 悲しい 
53:39 | Megiddo: status effect
53:45 | HashSlash: Sad is a status that buffs defense
53:45 | Suukotto Funsha: a status effect I think
53:52 | Akka Oni: Sad... like the emotion. かなし
53:55 | max r: emotion skill = status effect. the game will teach you soon.
53:58 | Chloro [クロロ]: I think it's a debuff?
54:16 | Aggressive Quack: yee the game will teach you the status soon
54:23 | Silverion: Emotions are status effects, they work like じゃんけん
54:34 | CantDood: oh you can inflict status effects on allies too
54:43 | Aggressive Quack: oh no
54:53 | Arcterion: This game works with a rock-paper-scissors system for emotions.
54:53 | Megiddo: actual toast
54:55 | SkysNotTheLimit: UH OH
54:56 | Zeng: too strong
54:58 | Neo: you can do it !
54:58 | max r: you became bread
55:05 | Verijero: KA KA KA KACHI DAZE
55:08 | MiiMuu: totally toast!
55:08 | Suukotto Funsha: Oh no
55:09 | Ekusupuroshon: I refuse
55:10 | max r: 🍞
55:15 | Stray Wolf: toast = dead 
55:20 | Mags Durandal: It'll be okay! You can do it!
55:21 | Silverion: Omori can hold on at 1HP once per battle
55:22 | Chloro [クロロ]: Toast!?
55:25 | max r: when we die, we become toast
55:27 | Aggressive Quack: Bear too strong to fall
55:38 | estratos13: Bread?
55:38 | Nasty Yukari: 一生懸命!
55:40 | Des Dichado: 💪🐻‍❄
55:41 | Mew: It's a pun, english people say "you're toast" when you get defeated 
55:46 | Arcterion: Toast is a joke, it means 'defeated' in slang.
55:51 | Ekusupuroshon: Yummy Yummy Friends
55:51 | SkysNotTheLimit: Don't eat your friends!
55:52 | Suukotto Funsha: Bear too strong
55:55 | MiiMuu: add some butter and they'll feel better!
55:55 | Akka Oni: It's a play on word. "You're toast" is another way to say "you're dead".
56:00 | Nasty Yukari: Mogu mogu friends
56:05 | Hanabi: "toast" can be slang for getting beat up
56:06 | Aggressive Quack: oh well till she learns how to revive a ally
56:18 | Akka Oni: In this case they literally became toast.
56:44 | Arcterion: Omori is strong because he's the main character, obviously. 😛
56:53 | Akka Oni: Because he's sad boi
56:55 | Silverion: This game has a lot of English wordplay so it's going to be fun watching Beatani learn all of it
56:55 | Ekusupuroshon: Bad friends get the punch
57:15 | Sunspots: nice sfx
57:15 | るむ: 主人公だから
57:29 | Meneltir: Tsundere boss
57:43 | kevzor: tsundere boss
57:45 | Aggressive Quack: b-baka
57:45 | Arcterion: Oh, and when fighting enemies, Happy beats Angry, Angry beats Sad, Sad beats Happy. This will be very useful later in the game and during boss battles.
57:50 | Ekusupuroshon: Tree cosplay
57:53 | Verijero: is beatani tsundere?
58:00 | Mew: what a load of ボロニアソーセージ 
58:20 | MiiMuu: tsundere girls are best
58:25 | max r: Let's go beatani house! 🎉
58:36 | Verijero: good taste
58:45 | Aggressive Quack: Party time!
58:58 | kevzor: beatani is deredere!
59:14 | Ekusupuroshon: It's not like I like the bear or anything... 
59:14 | Akka Oni: Yes, looks like an item shop
59:47 | SkysNotTheLimit: The game said she can save near a picnic basket or something, right?
1:00:24 | HashSlash: Yeah you can only save at picnics
1:00:35 | Aggressive Quack: yee
1:00:53 | Ekusupuroshon: A pokemon?
1:00:59 | Silverion: Saving at picnic baskets is pretty fitting for a bear
1:01:07 | Verijero: mandragora
1:01:08 | MiiMuu: it's cute though!
1:01:36 | Mew: It's the nene hololive fanbase
1:01:43 | BasedBug: Look at this dood
1:02:04 | Ekusupuroshon: look at the top of his head
1:02:06 | Verijero: oddish!
1:02:12 | Silverion: He angy
1:02:15 | max r: hurt it!
1:02:17 | Canna: Looks like Beatani 
1:02:17 | Zeng: it is cute
1:02:24 | Aggressive Quack: angy plant
1:02:25 | MiiMuu: it looks like nazonokusa from pokemon
1:02:26 | Mew: 🐱🐱
1:02:26 | Ekusupuroshon: Kill it!!!
1:02:26 | Theblekedet: looks like a slime
1:02:37 | Stray Wolf: he does look like a pokemon 
1:02:51 | Verijero: what a ferocious bear
1:02:57 | Akka Oni: Angry increases attack, lowers defence
1:02:57 | coba cobra: perfect win
1:02:58 | (Verified, Moderator) Streamlabs: Anonymous_Dad just tipped $2.50 dayo!
1:02:59 | SkysNotTheLimit: No toast this time!
1:03:00 | HashSlash: Theyre basically what if Mr Saturn was a slime enemy
1:03:01 | Mew: 🌿☠
1:03:04 | Ekusupuroshon: Exp yeah!!! Farming time
1:03:13 | Aggressive Quack: Anon based dad
1:03:49 | Lyrical Curry: Hi Bea
1:03:55 | Zeng: neat foes and neet friends
1:04:00 | Ekusupuroshon: A bestiary basically
1:04:32 | Ekusupuroshon: Ugly haha 
1:04:35 | coba cobra: pokedex
1:04:40 | Mew: >it smells like dirty laundry
1:04:42 | MiiMuu: I want to squish it
1:04:59 | Silverion: stinky sprout mole
1:05:01 | Mew: Poor bear these words
1:05:04 | awarmcomfybed: I couldn't join so far because I was in a meeting, hope our daughter is enjoying the game!
1:05:04 | Kemonomimi: Smelly lol
1:05:20 | Ekusupuroshon: Let's eat it
1:05:21 | Akka Oni: Beatani speedrunning the tutorial
1:05:44 | Absolute Link: this game seems like good english practice, for your advanced level
1:05:49 | Monolith Guy: People actually pay attention to tutorials?
1:05:51 | SkysNotTheLimit: These status effects are pretty cool
1:05:56 | Akka Oni: Happy increases critical chance, lowers hit rate.
1:05:58 | Arcterion: I love this game's music, not gonna lie.
1:06:21 | Akka Oni: Yeah, the music slaps
1:06:45 | SkysNotTheLimit: Ohh a combat triangle
1:06:45 | Arcterion: 'Clams' is also slang, by the way. It's a bit outdated though.
1:06:55 | Mew: Happy beats! 
1:06:58 | MiiMuu: you got it!
1:06:58 | Verijero: happy > angry, angry > sad, sad > happy
1:07:10 | Ekusupuroshon: Steamed clams
1:07:11 | Silverion: It's rock-paper-scissors, but they have side effects too
1:07:13 | Aggressive Quack: based hero
1:07:31 | Hanabi: sounds pretty RPS/janken to me
1:07:48 | Aggressive Quack: doesnt sadness also ignore defense?
1:07:58 | Ekusupuroshon: saisho wa gu
1:08:04 | Mew: Why does sad make you fast?
1:08:06 | Zlayer: janken -> rock paper scissors
1:08:26 | Akka Oni: Sadness increases defence. It also does some damage to Juice instead of Heart
1:08:39 | Mew: 😥
1:08:41 | Akka Oni: It reduces attack though
1:08:50 | Rob G.: 😢
1:09:05 | SkysNotTheLimit: Oh no, my juice
1:09:19 | MiiMuu: I want to なでなで the sprout mole
1:09:44 | Mew: The music is surprisingly good 
1:09:56 | Akka Oni: This system becomes important later
1:10:22 | Rob G.: the weak should fear the strong
1:10:23 | Ekusupuroshon: Don't worry bear, just rip and tear
1:10:23 | Brandon21: it's the cute and funny bear!
1:10:25 | Akka Oni: Omocat hired some great composers for this game
1:10:55 | Verijero: my gyaru bear cant be this cute...
