1:07:45 | (New member) Xayn: It has several uses. It can be nonsensical, or refers to "narratives" in particular.
1:07:45 | (New member) The Pope: Rrat = Narrative
1:07:46 | (New member) AdrenalineL1fe: naRRATive = rumor
1:07:47 | (New member) Randel Shurker: rrat, aka, speculation.
1:07:47 | (New member) Fake Name: /vt/ slang

1:08:16 | (New member) ThatVidyaGuy: a rrat is a rumor or a narrative 
1:08:26 | (New member) Steven Frati: It's applying meaning to something that may not be there.
