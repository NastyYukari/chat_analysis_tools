36:08 | TWAIN: 55%...
36:11 | HashSlash: You guys are speaking math
36:18 | Rye Mountain: If you add up all the different taxes an average swedish person pays than 44% of the wage goes to tax in the end.

36:32 | Zeng: his heart is broken and also Omori stabbed him

1:08:19 | Verijero: 4u
1:08:20 | O5060403: In blackjack you need to get 21 points with cards. Each cards is worth their number . Jack, Queen, and King are worth 10, ace is 1 or 11 depending on what's more convenient.
1:08:26 | O5060403: If you go over 21 you instantly lose.
1:08:41 | CantDood: mom got the anime dad syndrome
1:08:45 | O5060403: At the end you need to have 21 or more than the "house" or the dealer.
1:08:51 | imalittle cupcake: Clean your room, daughter

1:10:54 | max r: social bear
1:11:01 | O5060403: Don't really know why 21. It came from France and was initially called "twenty one" but later renamed "blackjack" because the combination of an ace of spades with a jack of clubs was an instant win.
1:11:03 | Tachi: Open!
1:11:05 | coba cobra: polite bear

2:06:33 | Ekusupuroshon: Otakus are hated üòû
2:06:43 | thelastshinobi56: he took the knife from Beatan
2:06:48 | Hanabi: given how people are treating beatan I think they dislike him just because he's friends with beatan
2:07:02 | 92Pesonen: I hope you healed yourself ü§£
2:07:17 | Kyle: Candy is drug
2:07:24 | Sunspots: Kel sticks his nose were he is not wanted. Probably what the game is trying to convey

2:14:53 | Rye Mountain: no justice for otaku
2:15:01 | 92Pesonen: You can only heal with medkits/ band aids in real life
