30:39 | shadowmaverick15: Hello cute bear
30:52 | dataso: EASY MODO????????????
31:01 | Megiddo: assert dominance
31:08 | Hanabi: not just smarter than the average bear, but stronger than one too
31:16 | MBmasher: yes beatani is the easy mode expert
31:32 | Nasty Yukari: Epic shit
31:47 | _XnT: I thought I saw EXmode, but it's actually EZmodo..
31:54 | Megiddo: easy mode in Touhou still harder than most games hard mode
32:06 | Noon C.: no problem at all
32:07 | Rye Mountain: "easy modo" is from a touhou music video
32:14 | dataso: no problem no problem
32:21 | I like the spikeman: It is EX Easy mode :^)
32:34 | _XnT: everything daijoubu
33:11 | Megiddo: focusing bear
33:32 | SuppahTenko: There is an easy mode?

35:07 | RobDeLaMort: Niiiice >:D
35:12 | Stray Wolf: Easy modo is a meme (originally called kimoi girls) that was repurposed for touhou due to being featured in a video by IOSYS called Overdrive. 
35:32 | Globalnet626: BEAR!
36:07 | Leyva Diaz Alejandro Ivan: dearest bear
36:28 | RobDeLaMort: Panik bear
36:54 | ChefHART: based bear!
37:11 | SuppahTenko: If your goal is to beat normal mode, it's quicker to start on normal. Depending on the game easy might lull you into bad behaviour.
37:18 | dataso: you're doing great
37:32 | Zwelltic: sturdy bear!
37:46 | RobDeLaMort: Oooh fancy, going to the top to get all the points. Beatani is professional Touhou player now

39:40 | Nasty Yukari: Dog too strong. orz
40:08 | RobDeLaMort: Dog cheated
40:14 | Nasty Yukari: You did well though!
40:25 | Suukotto Funsha: Dog is weak compared to Beatani
40:26 | Fake Name: I think you should try normal at least once
41:13 | RobDeLaMort: >_<
41:30 | Suukotto Funsha: Doggo beaten
41:51 | james heller: Dumb bear...
41:55 | coba cobra: bear become weaker

45:25 | Suukotto Funsha: 6 stages total in the game

49:20 | Fake Name: GANBARE
49:23 | Zwelltic: less do this beatani, stay strong!
49:28 | RobDeLaMort: I mean... What's the worst that could happen?
49:31 | MaxMexMix bruh: Is this the game that came with Hey Mister 2?
49:35 | Nasty Yukari: Yeah, your character is actually a dot in the inside
49:37 | Hanabi: do not peropero the bullets
49:40 | Transcendental_ColonThree: GANBAROOOOO
