38:23 | BasedBug: 100 people in a real-life concert is quite a bit
38:26 | CommanderMichael: 103 here
38:30 | Canna: Youtube count is way off 
38:31 | ThatVidyaGuy: The count of youtube is lower than what it should be.
38:31 | Hanabi: we've definitely got over 100
38:35 | stuffed idiot: youtube doesn't like oversea dads
38:36 | Mechanized Doge: it's 102 here
38:36 | sp33d4l0l: youtube counter a shit, a SHIT
38:37 | Sheep: I see 101 lol

38:45 | Andrew Ryan: 103
38:46 | Zia: Youtube lies, don't worry
38:49 | BasedBug: TURN OFF THAT AD BLOCK
38:53 | Absolute Link: it's probably closer to 1500 tbh
38:53 | Theblekedet: 102 here
38:54 | Zia: If you put a poal you'll see
39:11 | MBmasher: what? isn't it actually 1 billion
39:12 | The Sword Art Online Dickriding Association: Imagine being on stage in front of 100 people, it's quite a bit
39:13 | Zia: Youtube doesn't count ghosts sadly
39:14 | BasedBug: Youtube lies, Homeless dad dies
39:19 | Randel Shurker: Youtube lies about numbers
39:21 | Hanabi: the count will sort itself out by the time the archive goes up either way
39:22 | Megiddo: based Bear sees through Youtube's lies
39:24 | Canna: There was 150 waiting before the stream started 
39:26 | Randel Shurker: Susan trying to nerf Vtubers!
39:28 | Andrew Ryan: everyone should send a chat so we know you're here
39:30 | Jackku Chan: That's quite a big audience! 
39:35 | Tachi: Yeah YouTube is silly and doesn't show all the dads
39:36 | Shippo: it's way more than 120
39:37 | みろこ[Miroko]: Cunning Bear
39:38 | Rye Mountain: The views that can be seen after the stream ended is the most important I think
39:38 | CommanderMichael: youtube has accuracy issues
39:39 | Börk Börk: chat rollcall
39:42 | stuffed idiot: youtube is very picky about who it counts as viewers
39:44 | Aggressive Quack: Yea just refreshed and its 107
39:45 | Zia: Youtube hates dead people for some reason
39:46 | Theblekedet: LURKERS COME OUT!
39:47 | RueTobas: there's AT LEAST 200 people in here
39:51 | ThatVidyaGuy: There were 150 of us before the stream started. There should be way more than 120.
39:54 | LassesAffar: Before you stream it's the number of people waiting. When you start, everyone needs to refresh the page or they won't count
39:54 | Mew: Does adblock affect it?
39:54 | LadyCaitlin0429: YouTube seems to hate showing correct numbers
40:05 | gyroninja: youtube doesn't count suspicious accounts / viewers in the live count 
40:06 | Steven Frati: Tracking the Likes is best way to head count dads, moms, brothers sisters. Please remember to like our daughters performance right away!
40:13 | Yamoyashi: beeeeeeeeaaataniiiii
40:13 | bulletfodder: youtube has shadowbanned a lot of people
40:22 | Zia: Suspicious dads aren't counted...
40:27 | Destoroyar Fortress: Since Youtube doesn't know how to count, reaching 100 viewers is actually pretty impresive
40:34 | Monkberry Moon: Youtube bug
40:34 | XeniVari: Server synchronization and adding numbers is too hard, please understand.
40:35 | stuffed idiot: if you have adblock on it won't count you
40:44 | Börk Börk: Homeless dads aren't counted anymore
40:48 | imalittle cupcake: Small indie company...
40:53 | Shippo: true
40:57 | Rye Mountain: On this account I only watch beatani and nothing else, youtube may find that suspicous
40:59 | Mew: Indeed do you best!

41:14 | BasedBug: The numbers will glitch, but many people will always watch!
41:15 | gyroninja: Focus on putting on a good stream than worry about numbers
41:15 | Steven Frati: Beatani would give her best if there were 10 or 10000 viewers.
