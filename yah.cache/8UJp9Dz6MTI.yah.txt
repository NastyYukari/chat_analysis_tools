5:04 | pakkanen: video is artifacting again
5:05 | Absolute Link: this is an odd looking game in general lol
5:10 | imalittle cupcake: Encoding again?
5:12 | Jackku Chan: I guess it was just a bit laggy
5:16 | HashSlash: Apologies for the jinx fellas
5:19 | BasedBug: What kind of dad is she gonna make
5:21 | coba cobra: can see! but lagging
5:31 | Transcendental_ColonThree: Delicious 5fps, THE S O U L
5:33 | pakkanen: audio is fine, but video has some FPS issues
5:33 | Hanabi: I don't think it's a stream issue, maybe the game's just got settings too high
5:34 | hohoemikuma: the frame is laggy 
5:37 | Jackku Chan: I don't think it's the encoding, it seems like framerate lag.
5:38 | Pechorin: donmai
5:45 | pakkanen: it's better now
5:50 | A A: The rain effects probably causing it to chug.
5:50 | TWAIN: i think encoding is fine and it's just the game being demanding on the hardware
5:54 | RueTobas: it seems like
5:57 | RueTobas: when she alt tabs it fixes itself
5:58 | Megiddo: looks better now
5:59 | Monster hmc: i think its better now
6:05 | Monkberry Moon: Weird
6:05 | TWAIN: it's not freezing or anything, just getting lower fps
6:11 | Tachi: Maybe it's the game! You can try changing the settings?
6:12 | TWAIN: now it's smooth for example
6:15 | Jackku Chan: It could be an active window thing?
6:25 | Hanabi: it's running fine now so it's almost 100% the game running hard on the PC
6:26 | Akka Oni: Yeah! Just in time for watching!
6:32 | CommanderMichael: look for graphic settings
6:33 | imalittle cupcake: Oh yeah the game settings?
6:35 | BasedBug: Darkwood had a similar problem, it was the graphics settings
6:41 | coba cobra: oh yt fault?
6:53 | RueTobas: yeah as soon as she tabs in it lags
6:56 | RueTobas: It's 100% the game
6:58 | Jackku Chan: Yeah it lags when she switches to the game.
7:03 | Transcendental_ColonThree: VSYNC OFF
7:05 | Megiddo: 720p kusa
7:06 | Jackku Chan: It's an active window problem
7:10 | RueTobas: Turn off AMBIENT OCCLUSION
7:12 | TWAIN: yeah it looks like the rain is what causes the lag
7:12 | Akka Oni: Lower quality now, I guess
7:18 | pakkanen: yeah. it's the game that causes it. even Live2D model lags
7:24 | BasedBug: Lower allllll of it
7:34 | RueTobas: Ambient occlusion off please
7:36 | ThePlatinumCan: Ohadayo~
7:38 | Megiddo: turn off volume lighting I think?

10:35 | Xayn: This game is still early access since 2016?
10:36 | Akka Oni: It's hard to describe
10:44 | Tachi: Menu monster is spooky
10:48 | Jackku Chan: I'm thinking it's the active window limiting the framerate as it goes laggy when she tabs back ingame.
10:52 | Megiddo: @Exeklap that's normal for "early access" sadly
11:03 | Theblekedet: chkn is still in early access?
11:04 | RueTobas: ^ possible
11:11 | gyroninja: ambient occlusion is the lighting of stuff when there are no lights around
11:12 | BasedBug: How did you find out about this game?
11:12 | HashSlash: @Exeklap A lot of the reviews say the game was abandoned by the devs unfortunately
11:16 | Mister Eko: Fortnite is still early access...
