1:00:54 | Absolute Link: lmao
1:01:02 | gyroninja: You don't have to follow all of the items
1:01:13 | Suukotto Funsha: Sashimi is delicious
1:01:14 | max r: i had sushi for lunch today with sake
1:01:17 | Mew: Sashimi and Rice like Sushi 
1:01:20 | Ekusupuroshon: The bear likes her alcohol
1:01:42 | Mew: Damn shes good now
1:01:44 | Suukotto Funsha: Especially if you get to eat some freshly caught.
1:01:48 | Mew: Remember the first time she played 
1:01:49 | max r: could be chirashi... which is sashimi over rice
1:01:50 | max r: not sushi
1:02:22 | BasedBug: I think playing a little on Lunatic helped prepare her for this
1:02:29 | RueTobas: RIP
1:02:29 | Fettuccine フェットチーネ: wha
1:02:30 | Mew: wahhaa unlucky
1:02:33 | thelastshinobi56: that wasn't fair
