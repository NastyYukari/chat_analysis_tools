30:11 | Ukitsu2: "Plebian filter" is a meme
30:13 | Idle Bear: pleb = plebeian = commoner
30:14 | Arcterion: Pleb = plebeian = commoner/peasant
30:57 | GrassHopperMouse: I was on the phone for a few minutes and I come back to you guys teaching her these stuff.
31:06 | gyroninja: You are on Nihongo to Eigo
31:16 | nicenature: pleb = 平面
31:18 | na no: こんひよ　くまちゃん

35:34 | GrassHopperMouse: "dayo" is like "innit" in England
35:37 | GrassHopperMouse: I... think.
35:37 | Qはるけん: おはだよ
35:57 | GrassHopperMouse: exclamation

36:17 | hustler one: understandable-dayo
36:44 | OverMagnet: くまだよ
36:49 | Outwith: @GrassHopperMouse ね would probably be a closer comparison I think?
36:54 | GrassHopperMouse: "innit" is England slang, it's spelled "isn't it"
36:56 | .sandrio: innit is a contraction of "isn't it"
36:57 | Arcterion: "Innit" is short for "isn't it", but basically acts as a filler word.
37:02 | GrassHopperMouse: "isn't it" said quickly would be "innit"
37:10 | Ninjaguy Dan: Innit is slang for "isn't it?"
37:11 | hustler one: British slang for "isn't it"
37:27 | Ninjaguy Dan: ex: This food is great, innit?
37:34 | na no: おねいがいします！！おはだよ
37:37 | Ukitsu2: I've never heard of "innit" before, either xD
37:52 | Nero: But what if it's not morning? Do I use kondayo?
38:06 | Arthur C.: Innit? Never heard of it either
38:09 | Sunspots: innit means ...isn't it? which is different. dayo is more similar to 'it is you know' so "it is morning you know" something like that
38:09 | nicenature: perfect
38:14 | OverMagnet: Nice!
38:14 | Idle Bear: Reminds me of a Canadian "eh"
38:30 | pakkanen: In Brittish English, you hear "mate" a lot after sentences
38:35 | GrassHopperMouse: yeah, "dayo" actually be more like the candian "eh" or an American "y'know"
38:42 | OverMagnet: かんぺき！
38:44 | GrassHopperMouse: It doesn't mean anything, like you said.
39:05 | .sandrio: well it's an expression that adds a bit of soul to a sentence without adding value
39:07 | Nero: ok
39:09 | GrassHopperMouse: It's morning if you just woke up 💪💪💪
39:10 | Ninjaguy Dan: Grasshopper is right, dayo is a lot like how canadians add "eh" at the end of sentences
39:13 | フェットチーネ: Makes sense
39:26 | Cameron Clarke: I'm gonna start saying goodmorning at night too, thank you beatani
39:41 | nicenature: it's best to wake up at night time and sleep when the sun rises.
39:50 | hustler one: Are bears nocturnal ?
39:57 | Sunspots: perfect canadian pronunciation, sasuga bear
40:01 | Syrup: every day is morning in XP world
40:02 | na no: "eh" is more like "ne" in japanese
40:17 | .sandrio: ye good olde xp pseudo lawn
40:19 | na no: "innit" is also more like "ne" in japanese
40:39 | Cameron Clarke: XP world is locked in at 11am

41:19 | GrassHopperMouse: "your words cheered me up"
41:27 | Sunspots: 👍
41:44 | Ukitsu2: Even if it's like 23:41 in Japan, right?
41:53 | Theblekedet: Right!
41:53 | Chloro [クロロ]: So Beatani doesn't sleep? ww

1:12:22 | Ukitsu2: But in English "otaku" means "big anime fan". In Japans means something different.
1:12:29 | Mew: Otaku in english is more "anime fan"
1:12:47 | Outwith: Berserk is really good

1:17:32 | GrassHopperMouse: To the point I'm tired of hearing about it.
1:17:41 | Mew: How far are you into watamote? 
1:17:45 | Arthur C.: Watamote is a classic

1:23:21 | A A: Simp to get Beatani a Switch.
1:23:23 | Ninjaguy Dan: Dragon Ball and Sailor Moon were huge factors in helping bring anime fans in the west
1:23:23 | Mew: Same here, problem is when you read manga you spoil the anime so it's not as fun.
1:23:26 | GrassHopperMouse: Man, Dragon Ball is popular everywhere
1:23:32 | Arcterion: Have you read Angel Densetsu? 😀 
1:23:43 | Theblekedet: I like manga better

1:24:28 | pakkanen: Streamlabs is program what some streamers use to stream in Youtube, Facebook and Twitch
1:24:35 | Stray Wolf: some people want you to setup an streamlabs 
1:24:37 | GrassHopperMouse: But Streamlab isn't as accessible as youtube
1:24:39 | Ukitsu2: Yeah, donations, tips, whatever you want to call it ^^
1:24:47 | Sunspots: streamlab is an alternative to youtube superchats 
1:24:47 | GrassHopperMouse: If she wants to grow she should stick to Youtube
1:24:53 | pakkanen: @GrassHopperMouse It is
1:25:23 | Listening Man: @GrassHopperMouse youtube takes way too much of that 
1:25:37 | ZUN TSUN: シンガポールからこんばんは！元気ですか？

1:28:33 | Sunspots: Amazon wishlist is also a good alternative for now, should help you procure what you need to stream. Like games and other things
1:28:34 | Chloro [クロロ]: has to wait for monetization (収益化) too, so it's understandable
1:28:35 | ZUN TSUN: メンバーほしいの？
1:29:36 | ZUN TSUN: かわいい熊ｗｗ
1:29:40 | OverMagnet: It'll happen sometime. No need to try and rush.
