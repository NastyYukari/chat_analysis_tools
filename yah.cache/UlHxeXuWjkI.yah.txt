2:08:03 | Farrel Clement: "Based on what?" is a meme response.
2:08:05 | Jor Leifur: Beatani is growing very quickly, yeah! You're gonna be a meme soon
2:08:05 | SkysNotTheLimit: バセド
2:08:06 | Karsh: VTubers overall are easy to make reaction images with
2:08:06 | Drachen: Beatani = Based
2:08:06 | 77Yuja_: oh
2:08:07 | Tachi: yes!

2:08:24 | Mechanized Doge: けっこうあってるね
2:08:25 | Farrel Clement: B: Based? On what?
2:08:25 | No Body: opposite of based is cringe
2:08:30 | Moeniki: What are your favorite Japanese memes? 
2:08:34 | SkysNotTheLimit: Beatani needs to teach us Japanese memes
2:08:47 | クラガリ葉月: 面白い
2:08:49 | Ark K.: does beatani even know what "based" means?
2:08:55 | Fluffy Fish: you are based on bears, probably
2:08:55 | SkysNotTheLimit: oh no
2:09:07 | Kyle: beatani has already mastered based and innit
2:09:09 | Farrel Clement: Do Japanese nerds still know Mona cat and OS-tans?
2:09:13 | CounterNexus: 🥒
2:09:18 | GrassHopperMouse: @Ark K. about as much as most of the people using it, to be honest.
2:09:23 | ユーネ / Yuune: very funny bear
2:09:29 | SkysNotTheLimit: ヌクモリチ？

2:10:11 | Mew: oh noo not updog
2:10:14 | Ark K.: just like updog
2:10:17 | Outwith: Just be careful throwing around the word based, especially on twitter - some people will get political about it
2:10:21 | StrangerSeen: She's 5
2:10:22 | 77Yuja_: updog???
2:10:22 | pakkanen: updog is "bait" meme
2:10:23 | Jor Leifur: would you like to know about updog?
2:10:24 | 「Loru Apollo」: ok ok
2:10:24 | CantDood: almost gottem
2:10:36 | OverMagnet: Please... you guys...
2:10:36 | ユーネ / Yuune: おもしろい
2:10:37 | Skaaberen Lab: Oh yeah, I don't think you announced your stream on Twitter. I bet you could get even more viewers next time if you do.
2:10:38 | Farrel Clement: "Updog? What is updog?" > "What's up, dog?"
2:10:56 | kaiserschmarrn_: you ruined it
2:10:58 | kaiserschmarrn_: its over
2:10:59 | EvilBetty: I hope she doesn't catch LIGMA from all this
2:11:01 | kaiserschmarrn_: its over for updog
2:11:06 | ユーネ / Yuune: wwwww
2:11:10 | kaiserschmarrn_: ^ not nice post

2:11:21 | D' Jean: who is joe
2:11:22 | GrassHopperMouse: @EvilBetty who the hell's steve jobs?

2:11:29 | Wayne Kerr: EN world has 4-ch BBS. but it is not popular as 4chan
2:11:31 | Theblekedet: jfc you guys
2:11:31 | Moeniki: Whats up dogは挨拶です
2:11:32 | Kyle: "What's up, dog" = "Hi, how are you"
2:11:32 | pakkanen: goddamit
2:11:52 | Jubes: big oof
2:11:54 | Farrel Clement: Yes, aisatsu
2:11:57 | Mew: It's like
2:11:57 | Mew: げんきが？
2:12:02 | Farrel Clement: Dog = Friend
2:12:04 | SkysNotTheLimit: Meme Class is my favorite class
2:12:06 | Farrel Clement: What's up, dog?
2:12:10 | Fluffy Fish: just a shitty meme
2:12:11 | Mechanized Doge: 物議を醸すかもしれないが、他の人がどう思うかに関係なく、自分にとっては同意できる意見。＜ーこれが「based」の代々の翻訳かな
2:12:12 | Admiral Smug: "What's up, dog" is a greeting in english. "What is up dog?" sounds like "What's up dog" 
2:12:20 | ユーネ / Yuune: kawaii
2:12:20 | Hanabi: the "dog" isn't necessary it's just part of a joke
2:12:36 | Mew: 🐕
2:12:41 | Jor Leifur: "What's up, dog?" is similar to "よぉ、友よ？" I think
2:12:42 | minus INT [マイナスイント]: 草
2:12:47 | Farrel Clement: "Hey, what's up?"
2:12:52 | Mechanized Doge: ドッジで十分です。名前言ってくれてありがとう。
2:13:05 | Mew: dog = とも
2:13:05 | pakkanen: Entire "updog" thing is to make other asking "what's updog?" which literally means "how are you, friend?". Once you get other tricked to ask that "updog", you answer "just fine thank you"
2:13:06 | GrassHopperMouse: "dog" is slang used to refer to a friend
2:13:07 | kaiserschmarrn_: VERY COOL SLANG
2:13:12 | Hertan: Do you know “up bear”?
