38:18 | (New member) Rye Mountain: Very good choices
38:30 | (New member) Steven Frati: When would you use HATE when you could use AWAY?
38:37 | (New member) Mister Eko: KEEP PUSHING

39:17 | (New member) Tianfang's Adventures: It's pretty cringe imo
39:18 | (New member) Peer: What
39:20 | (New member) Tachi: Cringe..
39:21 | (New member) Big Gold: Cringe
39:23 | (New member) Peer: I didnt pressure anyone
39:25 | (New member) Kazoo: you are Queen of handreps
39:25 | (New member) Lazm: üèãÔ∏è‚úä
39:27 | (New member) Mister Eko: how do you draw handreps anyway
39:34 | (New member) The Pope: „Ç≠„ÉÉ„É¢„Éº„Éº„Éº„Éº„Ç§
39:37 | (New member) Stray Wolf: cringe
39:37 | (New member) Mobius: I miss ‚ñ° already..
39:44 | (New member) Mister Eko: a bottle of pills?
39:47 | (New member) LapanNaxela: fist with speedlines?

40:12 | (New member) Tachi: Bottle is good
40:14 | (New member) Stray Wolf: pills with kanji for kusuri in front? 
40:18 | (New member) Rye Mountain: I like a pile
40:24 | (New member) Hanabi: pill bottles are usually transparent orange
40:26 | (New member) nona: bottle
40:26 | (New member) Stray Wolf: pills of green and purple color 
40:29 | (New member) Hanabi: at least here, I don't know about japan
40:31 | (New member) Kazoo: I think a bottle will look better
40:33 | (New member) Ekusupuroshon: bottle
40:34 | (New member) The Pope: Bottle's good
40:37 | (New member) Original Japes: green and purple pills
40:38 | (New member) gyroninja: STATS :_yah: 707 9% :_oha: 969 13% :_dayo: 761 10% :_bea: 906 12% ‚ñ° 799 10% :_kita: 975 13% :_sprdo: 2517 32% :_nukutea: 111 0%

41:06 | (New member) Big Gold: Bottle is better

41:15 | (New member) The Pope: Thanks doc
41:19 | (New member) Stray Wolf: thanks doc

41:27 | (New member) Antonio Badilla: thanks doc
41:30 | (New member) Ekusupuroshon: Hanabi-san love...
41:35 | (New member) Peer: thanks doc
41:38 | (New member) Mister Eko: maybe too small
41:43 | (New member) Hanabi: my art isn't that good
42:17 | (New member) Zhnigo: take med and do rep
42:19 | (New member) Mister Eko: maybe with color it will be more redeable?
42:22 | (New member) Rye Mountain: It's easier to see when it has color
42:30 | (New member) Stray Wolf: a big pill would be better 
42:38 | (New member) Mister Eko: c-cute
42:40 | (New member) TWAIN: maybe a pile of pills after all?
42:40 | (New member) Stray Wolf: make it green and purple 
42:43 | (New member) Kazoo: words too small bottle is fine
42:46 | (New member) Tachi: It's fine if it's simple 
42:56 | (New member) Mister Eko: oh no
42:56 | (New member) TWAIN: AU PAS CAMARADES AU PAS CAMARADES AU PAS AU PAS AU PAS
43:07 | (New member) Stray Wolf: it's what the doctor recommends
43:08 | (New member) Tachi: Thanks doc :_sprdo:
43:09 | (New member) Mister Eko: green and purple is a meme
43:12 | (New member) anonEDM: it's part of the daily dose
43:18 | (New member) Tianfang's Adventures: I'm not explaining that.
43:21 | (New member) Jacob: look up "thanks doc" meme
43:26 | (New member) Jacob: or daily dose
43:34 | (New member) Hanabi: it's a very yabai story
43:35 | (New member) Peer: lol
43:35 | (New member) Ark K.: yabai
43:36 | (New member) Tuffee: oh no
43:37 | (New member) Lazm: Dr piccolo
43:37 | (New member) Tachi: What have you done
43:40 | (New member) Luginov: i feel like thats a bad thing to look up lol
44:00 | (New member) Mister Eko: oh no
44:00 | (New member) Suukotto Funsha: What did you do dads
44:08 | (New member) Ark K.: dads, what the heck???
44:10 | (New member) TWAIN: it's fine, it's not yabai outside context
44:12 | (New member) Mister Eko: *YAB EMOTE*
44:14 | (New member) Suukotto Funsha: Oh no no no
44:14 | (New member) Zia: ?
44:17 | (New member) Tachi: :_sprdo::_sprdo:
44:20 | (New member) Zhnigo: not again
44:21 | (New member) Ekusupuroshon: oh no ..
44:23 | (New member) Hanabi: this is why we need a Yab emote
44:24 | (New member) Tianfang's Adventures: Oh god
44:26 | (New member) Luginov: dads..
44:27 | (New member) Stray Wolf: now we can use YAB emote
44:28 | (New member) Lazm: Dr piccolo prescribed medicine to vegeta
44:29 | (New member) LapanNaxela: kek
44:31 | (New member) Tianfang's Adventures: I'm sorry
44:35 | (New member) Ark K.: yabeeeee
44:35 | (New member) Peer: :_sprdo:
44:36 | (New member) Stray Wolf: kek
44:36 | (New member) The Pope: Y-yabeeeee
44:36 | (New member) anonEDM: kek
44:37 | (New member) TWAIN: thanks doc
44:38 | (New member) Tuffee: lmao
44:39 | (New member) Ekusupuroshon: Wtf dads!
44:45 | (New member) Suukotto Funsha: FOOLISH DADS
44:54 | (New member) Peer: good old memes
44:59 | (New member) The Pope: You need to thank the doctor, Bea
45:01 | (New member) Mister Eko: I can't believe Bea is looking at dirty things while streaming...
45:05 | (New member) Lazm: pure bear away
45:06 | (New member) Jacob: it's a massive part of western culture
45:07 | (New member) Luginov: cute
45:12 | (New member) Steven Frati: Thanks doc!
45:17 | (New member) Ark K.: thanks doc
45:23 | (New member) CantDood: gracias doctor
45:23 | (New member) A A: Tongue clocks are cute.
45:26 | (New member) Margrave: lol
45:28 | (New member) Stray Wolf: now the YAB emote is justified 
45:28 | (New member) A A: clicks oops
45:35 | (New member) LapanNaxela: thanks doc
45:41 | (New member) Lazm: Bea, you're supposed to say "thanks, doc"
45:45 | (New member) Mister Eko: cucte
45:47 | (New member) Ekusupuroshon: Med but with another color
46:36 | (New member) Mister Eko: oh no
46:43 | (New member) Peer: thanks doc
46:45 | (New member) Stray Wolf: thanks doc 
46:45 | (New member) Ekusupuroshon: pi
46:47 | (New member) Tuffee: based
46:48 | (New member) Hanabi: I think a MEDS emote would look best at an angle, and probably replace the text with an image of a pill or something since the text would be hard to read at small size
46:49 | (New member) Mister Eko: thanks...
46:49 | (New member) Luginov: thanks doc
46:53 | (New member) Ark K.: danke, doktor
47:04 | (New member) Zia: Alright
47:10 | (New member) Lazm: green and purple ‚û°Ô∏è thanks doc
47:12 | (New member) Ekusupuroshon: I'm satisfied yes!
47:16 | (New member) TWAIN: thangs dog :_sprdo:
47:17 | (New member) Suukotto Funsha: thanks doc
47:28 | (New member) Stray Wolf: danke doktor 
47:39 | (New member) LapanNaxela: Grazie Dottore
47:46 | (New member) Tachi: :_sprdo: 
47:50 | (New member) Mister Eko: dads... what have you done...
47:56 | (New member) max r: we have multi colored pills? nice :_sprdo:
48:07 | (New member) Ark K.: green and purple pills
48:08 | (New member) Tachi: Perfect
48:09 | (New member) Rye Mountain: Green and purple is ok
48:15 | (New member) max r: are these the fun meds?
48:17 | (New member) TWAIN: great idea
48:22 | (New member) gyroninja: 24x24 pixels isn't much to work with
48:30 | (New member) Stray Wolf: it's your daily doze 
49:24 | (New member) Rye Mountain: It's not bad out of context 
49:34 | (New member) Tianfang's Adventures: you have plausible deniability 
49:34 | (New member) Stray Wolf: nah it's fine 
49:41 | (New member) Ark K.: ‚ñ°
49:43 | (New member) Hanabi: green and purple is one of those things where it's only yabai with context and 99% of the time people won't think anything of it
49:44 | (New member) TWAIN: it's okay, you're just drawing a pill
49:44 | (New member) Mister Eko: lol
49:48 | (New member) Tuffee: won't get you into trouble
49:53 | (New member) Mobius: No one will notice
49:57 | (New member) Suukotto Funsha: you won't get in trouble just never show the gif
49:59 | (New member) The Flesh Is Weak: thanks Doc...
50:00 | (New member) max r: okayy? okay.
50:03 | (New member) Mister Eko: it's ok
50:09 | (New member) Stray Wolf: it's called being subtle 
50:12 | (New member) Zhnigo: rrat
50:41 | (New member) Mister Eko: cute...
51:02 | (New member) max r: oil balons get special idiot dad emote
51:12 | (New member) max r: FOOLISH DADS AWAY
51:16 | (New member) Yamoyashi: Meds!
51:34 | (New member) Hanabi: oil balons don't deserve a special emote, they deserve nothing
51:50 | (New member) Zhnigo: green and burble:_sprdo:
52:00 | (New member) Yamoyashi: mic's a bit weird
52:12 | (New member) LassesAffar: sugoi
52:13 | (New member) Voltage: hello:_sprdo:gumA:_sprdo:
52:14 | (New member) Mister Eko: maybe there's too many details, the emote is pretty small
52:15 | (New member) Tuffee: cute
52:16 | (New member) Rye Mountain: Maybe another background
52:20 | (New member) Tianfang's Adventures:  its beautiful :_sprdo:
52:23 | (New member) 77Yuja_: s-sugoi
52:26 | (New member) Zeng: its good
52:28 | (New member) Zed: thanks doc
52:31 | (New member) Ekusupuroshon: oh god...
52:35 | (New member) Steven Frati: It's nice detail but might be hard to read at small size. Having a solid color bottle might read easier.
52:37 | (New member) Zhnigo: mic seems fine?
52:40 | (New member) Stray Wolf: Gracias Doctor 
52:44 | (New member) Tachi: Do you think the bottle would be better if orange?
52:45 | (New member) Zia: Maybe the label needs to be bigger to be seen, since emotes are small
52:50 | (New member) Yamoyashi: oh sounds better
52:53 | (New member) Zia: Yeah
52:57 | (New member) Ark K.: hmm, yeah it's kinda hard to see
53:08 | (New member) Rye Mountain: Don't forget to make the background transparent
53:15 | (New member) max r: Clear orange bottle reminds me of a pill bottle, maybe only we need to show one pill.
53:31 | (New member) Yamoyashi: orange label maybe
53:34 | (New member) Voltage: orange med bottles are common in some places over sees
53:45 | (New member) Steven Frati: Orange bottle, big white label with pill.
54:25 | (New member) TWAIN: and now make the pill on the label go from corner to corner?
54:34 | (New member) Mister Eko: it looks better already
54:34 | (New member) Zia: Yeah doing emotes is very different from regular illustration
54:48 | (New member) max r: yeah i think this is a better direction
54:55 | (New member) TWAIN: if it's diagonal it's gonna be bigger
55:05 | (New member) Luginov: :_yah:
55:12 | (New member) Ekusupuroshon: :_nukutea:
55:27 | (New member) Zia: Better
55:28 | (New member) Suukotto Funsha: nice
55:35 | (New member) Stray Wolf: maybe? 
55:48 | (New member) Zia: label & bottle need to be different colour ofc
56:04 | (New member) max r: would that look better if the cap and label stays white but the bottle is changed to orange
56:06 | (New member) Ark K.: the bottle should be transparent maybe?
56:10 | (New member) Hanabi: maybe make the bottle orange so it stands out better
56:12 | (New member) BRAD AEON 720:  just say they're Eva-01 themed
56:23 | (New member) Ark K.: or orange works too
56:29 | (New member) Megiddo: nice!
56:32 | (New member) LapanNaxela: Your layer reps...
56:33 | (New member) Ekusupuroshon: yeah it's an Evangelion reference...
56:33 | (New member) max r: gotta get my tang pills
56:58 | (New member) Kazoo: get in the bottle Shinji
56:59 | (New member) Rye Mountain: Looks good
57:10 | (New member) Stray Wolf: looking better 
57:11 | (New member) Tuffee: nice
57:11 | (New member) Ekusupuroshon: nice...
57:15 | (New member) Rye Mountain: Remember to make the background transparent
57:16 | (New member) Stray Wolf: yes
57:17 | (New member) Hanabi: looks good
57:18 | (New member) LapanNaxela: i think it looks better with the pure orange bottle
57:19 | (New member) Megiddo: yes, much more visisble!
57:20 | (New member) Mister Eko: perfect
57:20 | (New member) Suukotto Funsha: That looks better
57:22 | (New member) Tianfang's Adventures: yes nice
57:26 | (New member) LapanNaxela: and just the pill on the label
57:29 | (New member) Peer: better
57:35 | (New member) Steven Frati: It reads easier without the pills inside the bottle.
57:38 | (New member) anonEDM: much better now
57:45 | (New member) Ark K.: wait, why is the pill inside red and green?
57:47 | (New member) TWAIN: maybe the outline of the pill black instead of purple
57:55 | (New member) Stray Wolf: danke herr doktor 
57:57 | (New member) Jacob: the orange overlay probably
57:58 | (New member) Hanabi: the thing about emotes is you can't get too detailed because of the small size
57:58 | (New member) Zhnigo: safety cap
58:17 | (New member) Hanabi: I mean, if they're in an orange bottle, they won't look the same as if they were in a clear bottle
58:17 | (New member) Stray Wolf: "it's the orange fault"
58:22 | (New member) Zia: pills inside bottle can't be seen at this size anyway
58:22 | (New member) Stray Wolf: orange hate
58:28 | (New member) Megiddo: bootleg pills
58:35 | (New member) Rye Mountain: Make the background transparent
58:43 | (New member) max r: it looks good, just transparent background
58:49 | (New member) CantDood: it looks good
58:54 | (New member) XeniVari: I think it'll be better without seeing the pills inside. The label already gives enough info, the insides look a little too "spotty" in such a small resolution.
59:05 | (New member) Ekusupuroshon: SMASH YOUR MUGS
59:11 | (New member) AdrenalineL1fe: i cant see shit..
59:20 | (New member) Luginov: mug bros..
59:23 | (New member) Mister Eko: A mug broken in two halves? -> üíî
59:27 | (New member) Zhnigo: breaking my mug for reference
59:33 | (New member) max r: I had the same thought as xenivari, but we might not be able to see until it's actually being used.
59:41 | (New member) Zia: Broken in 2 to avoid too much details
59:45 | (New member) Steven Frati: Broken handle and top corner.
59:52 | (New member) TWAIN: :_yah:
59:54 | (New member) LapanNaxela: yes
59:55 | (New member) Rye Mountain: I think it is better
59:56 | (New member) Tuffee: that works
59:56 | (New member) Tachi: :_yah:
59:57 | (New member) Zia: yeah better
59:57 | (New member) LapanNaxela: good
1:00:00 | (New member) Mister Eko: yep
1:00:03 | (New member) max r: yeah i think thats better, xenivari for president
1:00:03 | (New member) XenMaster220: Those meds looked good!
1:00:03 | (New member) Steven Frati: Looks better without pills inside.
1:00:08 | (New member) Ekusupuroshon: naisu
1:00:12 | (New member) XeniVari: Nice.
1:00:25 | (New member) Hanabi: if you need a reference just throw your own mug on the floor
1:00:25 | (New member) Ark K.: thats good
1:00:29 | (New member) Theblekedet: good
1:00:31 | (New member) Steven Frati: Meds complete!
1:00:31 | (New member) max r: thank you based oil balon chama
1:00:55 | (New member) Mister Eko: the handle would be a little too small to see, I think
1:00:58 | (New member) Zia: Look like someone took a bite out of that Mug
1:01:27 | (New member) Hanabi: oil balon HATE
1:01:30 | (New member) Zia: Small pieces will not be seen
1:01:34 | (New member) TWAIN: coffee spilling out of the mug could be an idea?
1:01:35 | (New member) Ekusupuroshon: I have a complete list of all the oil barons
1:01:41 | (New member) Zia: Foolish barons...
1:01:49 | (New member) Ark K.: what is this emote supposed to convey?
1:01:54 | (New member) Rye Mountain: Maybe a hammer in the corner
1:01:56 | (New member) CantDood: needs to be more broken I think
1:02:02 | (New member) Rye Mountain: Hammer head
1:02:02 | (New member) Lodowa Wrozka: maybe broken in half?
1:02:10 | (New member) max r: andrew ryan is honorary oil balon
1:02:12 | (New member) BRAD AEON 720: the handle should be the only recognisable part of a smashed mug
1:02:38 | (New member) Zia: Small pieces on ground won't be seen from afar
1:02:47 | (New member) TWAIN: it works
1:02:47 | (New member) LapanNaxela: haard to recognize
1:02:49 | (New member) Tuffee: the small pieces might be impossible to see
1:02:51 | (New member) Mister Eko: maybe broken in two halves? like -> üíî
1:02:59 | (New member) max r: i'm not really liking it... it is hard to see what this is, even with the handle.
1:03:09 | (New member) Hanabi: broken mug is hard to do because it either doesn't look broken enough or it's too hard to see as an emote
1:03:10 | (New member) LapanNaxela: fatter handle?
1:03:28 | (New member) Rye Mountain: Split in half is maybe a good idea
1:03:29 | (New member) Lodowa Wrozka: broken in half like a heart
1:03:32 | (New member) max r: i also have trouble seeing the ‚ñ° emote, but is that because i am in dark mode ?
1:03:35 | (New member) Zia: Broken in 2 in the middle
1:03:39 | (New member) Voltage: :_sprdo::_sprdo::_sprdo::_sprdo:
1:03:56 | (New member) Zia: like üíî but a Mug
1:03:59 | (New member) Original Japes: mugu mugu
1:04:01 | (New member) AdrenalineL1fe: @max r yes, it's ok in the light one
1:04:02 | (New member) gyroninja: max some platforms render the emotes at 24x24
1:04:13 | (New member) LapanNaxela: yes max, try opening it as an image
1:04:19 | (New member) LapanNaxela: you can sort of read it then
1:04:20 | (New member) Hanabi: even in light mode it's still too squished
1:04:28 | (New member) LapanNaxela: but on dark theme it's hard
1:04:29 | (New member) TWAIN: ‚ñ° could be redrawn to have BAS at the top and ED at the bottom
1:04:43 | (New member) Mister Eko: I don't think the small broken pieces are needed
1:04:50 | (New member) TWAIN: that mug looks ok to me :_yah:
1:04:51 | (New member) Mister Eko: you can appreciate it's a mug without them
1:04:58 | (New member) Ark K.: i can't even see the pieces
1:04:59 | (New member) LapanNaxela: fatter lines?
1:05:00 | (New member) RBZE7: "BASED" could be just your head with sunglasses and a cigar
1:05:00 | (New member) Tachi: It seems okay
1:05:01 | (New member) XeniVari: Broken in half is usually how emotes like that are done. The important info to convey is the object, and the fact its' broken. Clutter doesn't look good in small resolutions.
1:05:02 | (New member) AdrenalineL1fe: i'm telling you, text emotes are not good
1:05:05 | (New member) TWAIN: have coffee spill out

1:08:13 | (New member) XeniVari: Nice. Maybe the lines where it's split a little rougher. To signify smashing, rather than slicing.
1:08:18 | (New member) Hanabi: try adding a crack in the middle instead of it being a clean split?
1:08:25 | (New member) The Pope: Looks not smashed, but cut with a blade that's been folded 1,000 times lol
1:08:37 | (New member) Zia: Too clean of a split maybe, one dent would be nice
1:08:41 | (New member) Kazoo: she took her sword to the mug

1:10:52 | (New member) TWAIN: easier on the eyes than light mode

2:39:32 | (New member) LapanNaxela: I can't even jump from the 5m springboard...

2:41:39 | (New member) RBZE7: GJ for outing yourself as a brazilian Shippo-san
2:42:07 | (New member) The Pope: Nice ty ty
2:42:09 | (New member) Hanabi: I feel like the only way to do a handreps emote that isn't yab is to just draw a hand and then write "REPS" under it
2:42:12 | (New member) Mister Eko: for the handreps a hand lifting weight would be the safest thing
2:42:16 | (New member) Zia: Maybe hands under running water (washing)

2:48:24 | (New member) Ekusupuroshon: it looks like a hand hitting a table
2:48:25 | (New member) Zhnigo: no opposable thumb...
2:48:27 | (New member) The Pope: Lol draw it flicking away a bean or something
2:48:50 | (New member) TWAIN: my hand hurts trying to hold it like that
2:49:06 | (New member) Zhnigo: these are boy reps, i thought viewers were 98% female?
2:49:12 | (New member) The Pope: Death grip bros...
2:49:18 | (New member) Ekusupuroshon: your thumb reps...
2:49:21 | (New member) CantDood: or she wants to add an universal sign for both kinds of reps, but that's beyond her artistic skills... maybe?
2:49:23 | (New member) The Flesh Is Weak: she's asking Takuya for reference...
2:49:28 | (New member) Mister Eko: bea... your hand reps... of handreps...
2:49:29 | (New member) Zhnigo: the thumb is backwards...
2:49:35 | (New member) Zia: The best part of this emote is just beatani having to create it, even if it's not used
2:49:46 | (New member) Zhnigo: your hand reps reps...

2:50:56 | (New member) Tuffee: the emote is applicable at all times

2:50:59 | (New member) Mister Eko: aoi oni stream, of course... thinking about the puzles... 
2:50:59 | (New member) The Pope: RFA streams flooded with ‚úä
2:51:01 | (New member) TWAIN: maybe we should skip this emote until a good idea comes...
2:51:06 | (New member) Zia: It's not to use the emote, it's to see you having to create it

2:52:29 | (New member) Zhnigo: needs mosaic
2:52:50 | (New member) The Pope: CHKN dad's power is based on how many people are doing their hand reps
2:52:56 | (New member) 77Yuja_: think its awesome!

2:53:09 | (New member) Shippo: yab emote, don't draw it
2:53:10 | (New member) Hanabi: if he's filtered by the handreps emote he would never be part of the nukumority anyway
2:53:12 | (New member) Ekusupuroshon: they'll think Uooooooh
2:53:16 | (New member) Raziel: This is the deep end of the pool
2:53:19 | (New member) Zhnigo: they'll think we are all punching our desks
2:53:23 | (New member) Mister Eko: the nails are maybe a little weird
2:53:34 | (New member) The Pope: Lol I think they'll get the message very quickly

2:54:42 | (New member) Mister Eko: no bea... stop it... don't do this... someone stop her...
2:54:57 | (New member) A A: Needs some shaking lines for motion.

3:02:38 | (New member) No Body: i can work with this
3:02:39 | (New member) XeniVari: Not really. The text overlapping the hand can use work.
3:02:48 | (New member) nona: I do think it could use motion lines or motion blur.
3:02:59 | (New member) Margrave: Fat otaku hands
3:03:03 | (New member) Mister Eko: I promise to never use this emote during a live stream
3:03:06 | (New member) Zia: I mean if you REALLY want to have this emote sure

3:03:34 | (New member) Ark K.: how do you even use the emote while you're doing your hand reps?
3:03:47 | (New member) Mister Eko: oh no
3:03:48 | (New member) Zia: Have to pretype it
3:03:55 | (New member) CantDood: i think it's good because you can only understand it in the correct context, it just looks like a fierce fist otherwise
3:03:56 | (New member) The Pope: WiFi hands
3:03:57 | (New member) Mister Eko: the motion lines give it a new level of yab
3:03:58 | (New member) The Flesh Is Weak: :_sprdo:
3:04:00 | (New member) Margrave: LOL
3:04:04 | (New member) Mobius: Remove text?

3:04:32 | (New member) Mister Eko: it's so cringe it's perfect
3:04:38 | (New member) Tianfang's Adventures: that actually looks pretty good
