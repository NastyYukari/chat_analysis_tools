14:11 | TheCanti: I don't usually use emotes either but I'll post some here for support of the daughter
14:11 | Absolute Link: emotes are useful as reactions - keeps chat clean of "lol" and "i agree"

15:10 | OverMagnet: We now know that if Beatani is using an emoji she's being held histage.
15:15 | monkeynohito: 🐻‍❄based🐻‍❄
15:22 | Hanabi: emojis are lame, beatani emotes are based. simple as

34:34 | Shippo: voice chat with dads...
34:34 | Fettuccine フェットチーネ: I'm shy
34:40 | Raziel: If youtube had membership gifting like twitch I would help out some other dads
34:44 | Jackku Chan: Beatani yelling at dads on voice live!
34:44 | わはわはもも: Big voice!
34:45 | クラガリ葉月: 危ない
34:45 | scoutgamerfin: I want to say yab but...
34:47 | Δ: vermintide with the dads
34:47 | Theblekedet: voice chat with dads?!
34:50 | Rye Mountain: Getting abused by beatani in voice chat...
34:50 | max r: watchalong, community game, zatsu... anything works
34:53 | ThePlatinumCan: Wait, voice chat...?
34:57 | Rob G.: oh yeah, roast us while whispering 
34:57 | Destoroyar Fortress: I want Beatani to call me a useless neet
34:59 | imalittle cupcake: Lecturing dads on voice...
35:01 | Mechanized Doge: en: she wants to talk to her members of random topics
35:02 | TentacleTimeEternal -: voice chat?
35:05 | Flux: uuuooohhhh
35:07 | Mew: Punching dads, starving dads
35:12 | Steven Frati: Yah!
35:17 | BasedBug: A chorus of UUUOOOOHHHS in-game
35:18 | Tachi: Dad abuse
35:21 | CommanderMichael: watchalong with any western movie that she likes would be great
35:31 | Mechanized Doge: en: she believes since it's paid members it may be relatively safe
35:32 | Rob G.: UUUUUUOOOOOOOOH 😭
35:35 | Jackku Chan: It might be hard if you have a lot of members though!
35:39 | Shippo: very interesting
35:42 | Peer: it's not necessary to stream member-only, we will support you anyway
35:44 | MBmasher: oh god
35:46 | TheCanti: Aggressive Beatani..?
35:49 | BasedBug: That's a dangerous game you're playing
35:51 | Kemonomimi: oh no
35:54 | TentacleTimeEternal -: This dad is just going to make sure you're eating well while being verbally abused
35:54 | gyroninja: Another vtuber had membership streams with voice chat and nothing too bad happened
35:55 | Theblekedet: A-aggressive?!
35:56 | kevzor: if i have to hear any of these spergs' voices i'm leaving
35:57 | Δ: 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
35:57 | Monkberry Moon: Yabai
35:59 | CantDood: be careful of puritan youtube
36:02 | Mew: That is indeed kowai
36:05 | Fettuccine フェットチーネ: Indeed
36:06 | 123457474869: >100 people all talking at once
36:11 | Tachi: K-Kowa
36:15 | Zaxonite: N
36:16 | Mechanized Doge: ボイスチャットだったらどうやるのだろう？ツイッターグループなどかな?
36:20 | TheCanti: Yes, yes it is
36:24 | Lamb San: it is
36:25 | Rye Mountain: Sounds really dangerous 
36:27 | max r: Aggressive bear 🐻‍❄
36:30 | Rob G.: imagine all the spaghetti dropped
36:31 | 77Yuja_: yea
36:32 | TheCanti: Do not let people into a VC, especially randoms
36:40 | Joestar: It is, how about just games instead?
36:40 | ThePlatinumCan: Bold move, not gonna lie
36:41 | Theblekedet: oh that's kowai
36:41 | Mister Eko: veri danjerousi
36:45 | BasedBug: Buncha nervous dads stammering on voice chat, who wouldn't pay for that?
36:45 | Renekton FTW: Voice chat sounds a bit to far. Just saying for your safety.
36:48 | Jackku Chan: Normal stream voice chat? Yabee..
36:49 | monkeynohito: Any voice chat is dangerous, viewers are losers in general.
36:50 | Canna: Don't trust these dads to behave 
36:53 | pakkanen: NEVER allow anyone to do voice chat with you
36:55 | Mew: Well it's okay to try once
36:59 | Peer: we know how you are aggressive from yesterday's stream 🐻
37:05 | sp33d4l0l: randoms in VC on stream is just asking for yabs
37:11 | OverMagnet: The most scary thing for dads... being social! 
37:20 | Salty Sola: Never trust dads. Source: A dad.
37:21 | monkeynohito: Yeah, never voice chat, we don't want to hear each other
37:23 | ellescer: i mean you can try it once but if it goes to shit thens thats that
37:25 | max r: Dads better behave or we will see quickly why we can't have nice things
37:30 | TheCanti: Dads can be dangerous
37:31 | Mechanized Doge: twitter has a new group voice chat system now. group leader can actively mute and unmute selective people within that voice chat group.
37:35 | Monkberry Moon: It would be fun maybe
37:36 | Sheep: too yabai
37:37 | Tachi: Dads can be yabai 
37:38 | Mister Eko: spaghetti bros...
37:38 | 77Yuja_: dads are super predator be careful@
37:40 | A A: Watch out for marriage proposals.
37:52 | Mew: Dads going : MUSUME WE SUKI YOU 
37:56 | TheCanti: Maybe pick a single Dad?
37:57 | pakkanen: In collaboration streams, voice chat is allowed.
38:01 | Shippo: damnit, i want to vc with beatani
38:03 | MBmasher: collab with others?
38:04 | BasedBug: >I have no friends
38:04 | Mew: 😶‍🌫
38:05 | imalittle cupcake: Oh yeah...conversations are good for practice, that's true.
38:05 | Apousek: コラボしたら？
38:06 | Jackku Chan: Haha what a loser, she has no friends!
38:07 | Rob G.: 😢
38:08 | クラガリ葉月: かわいそう
38:08 | Stray Wolf: no friends? 
38:08 | TheCanti: A trustworthy Dad
38:09 | Tachi: Dad will get nervous
38:10 | Megiddo: bear is based. She wants to converse in English. Might as well try
38:10 | monkeynohito: Oh, it needs to be a proper dad then.
38:11 | Stray Wolf: 😭 
38:13 | Rye Mountain: Maybe only trusted regulars?
38:14 | Lamb San: she's just like me bros...
38:17 | Flux: the groomers.....
38:19 | Zed: 😭
38:20 | RueTobas: what about off stream?
38:20 | max r: Trusted dads and/or other vtubers ?
38:20 | 123457474869: well you can make a discord group i guess off stream
38:23 | BasedBug: I think collabing with an EN/JP Vtuber would work
38:33 | rashef: I will VC and practice Nihongo Jojo.
38:34 | Stray Wolf: oh english speaking friends
38:34 | Peer: so sad...
38:38 | Hanabi: have you thought about collabing with EN vtubers?
38:40 | クラガリ葉月: Maybe??
38:41 | kevzor: she has friends? dropped.
38:42 | ThePlatinumCan: Risky idea, but... maybe it would turn out well? It's worth trying
38:51 | MBmasher: beatani collab pog
38:51 | Peer: mayber?...
38:51 | scoutgamerfin: off-stream or at least unarchived
39:04 | Big Ron: Bear starts English live chats with Dads, Bear instantly bullies them all
39:06 | Jackku Chan: EN vtubers.. Can be.. Kind of Yabe too, though?
39:08 | monkeynohito: let's make Pocji collab with her, she wants english practice too.
39:11 | Rob G.: lol based
39:13 | 77Yuja_: en vtubers dangerous
39:14 | Stray Wolf: maybe that could work
39:15 | Theblekedet: maybe experiment in places other than youtube?
39:15 | Tachi: Maybe it can work, Bea can try voice chat if she wants
39:22 | A A: Be careful about who you collab with.
39:24 | kevzor: en vtubers are shit
39:35 | Megiddo: daughter doesn't want to leech
39:38 | Lamb San: you are too good for most EN vtubers lol
39:38 | Mew: You could try playing coop games with memebers like umm "Don't starve together" or shorter games like "Crash Bandicoot Racing or similar"
39:39 | SukiKirai: dads in voice chat will bully me because of my estonian accent
39:39 | Δ: so a give and take then
39:42 | TentacleTimeEternal -: I would personally be careful. Try it offline. Online there's a risk someone might try to say something that would get you in trouble.
39:44 | Flux: the numbers....
39:45 | TheCanti: Some people just like collabing for fun Beatani, it doesn't always need to be for business
39:51 | クラガリ葉月: You're cute. That's a merit.
39:53 | Joestar: Collab with other small vtuber
40:03 | Jackku Chan: What a business perspective
40:11 | Monkberry Moon: They'll find you
40:11 | Rob G.: capitalism, ho!
40:12 | Sheep: nice english correction
40:17 | Δ: Beatani is getting bigger
40:21 | Tachi: Don't collab if you don't want to right now it's okay
40:24 | Rye Mountain: There are many other small vtubers like you
40:27 | CommanderMichael: voice chat with dads can lead to some big yabai
40:28 | zero despair: Why don't you collab with the Vtubers who follow you?
40:34 | CantDood: yeah finding other underground vtubers to collab sounds hard
40:36 | Raziel: Beatani the Based Business Bear
40:36 | BasedBug: Voice chat would definitely be fun, but collab with small Vtuber would probably be better
40:45 | Stray Wolf: there are many small indies that are very welcoming 
40:56 | Mew: No way
41:00 | max r: I don't think that you are too small. But, I don't think you should feel forced to do it.
41:01 | Mister Eko: Don't worry about that!
41:04 | Flux: its bea youre cute they wont get mad
41:06 | クラガリ葉月: ???
41:07 | imalittle cupcake: Nice people exist too
41:13 | CommanderMichael: Plenty of smalltime indies are very kind beatani
41:13 | Stray Wolf: no, I don't think so
41:14 | LassesAffar: annoyed
41:15 | Mechanized Doge: 知っている人だと多分オッケイかも。ツイッターのグループチャットは、リーダーだけ他の人をミュート出来る事ができるのでけっこうセーフだと思う。たったべあたにさんをフォローするだけで参加できる。Zoom Call 見たいな機能。
41:19 | TheCanti: You speak good english and a lot of english speakers find accents cute and like seeing people try.
41:19 | ThePlatinumCan: Let's take things slowly (　’ω’)旦~~
41:23 | Jackku Chan: Some EN vtubers are really otaku and would probably like to talk to a japanese person that can speak english.
41:25 | Mew: Hololive colabs Indonesia, Japan, US, Germany it's fine people love it when you try to communicate
41:25 | BasedBug: Spread the word! Beatani wants to collab!
41:52 | Stray Wolf: no don't let her collab on her terms 
41:56 | pakkanen: Voice chat with viewers is usually uncontrolled CHAOS, which doesn't help at all
41:59 | Mechanized Doge: ボイスチャットの事です
42:00 | monkeynohito: Is there any ENTubers that are safe for her?
42:14 | max r: Could also do Discord, even if only for members. The server doesn't need to be permanent.
42:16 | Sheep: grooming arc is looming on us, can't wait
42:25 | 123457474869: BGM is a bit loud maybe
42:25 | Megiddo: the deer?
42:26 | CommanderMichael: a lot of small time vtubers are multilingual and you can learn a lot from them
42:32 | hustler one: koopa...
42:39 | Stray Wolf: maybe Koopa? 
42:43 | Δ: *ring ring* moshi moshi anonymous?
42:43 | ellescer: groomerchads...
42:47 | Flux: ENTER KOOPA
42:53 | Δ: koopa would be good
42:56 | imalittle cupcake: Maybe there's some vtubers that watch Beatani
42:57 | Rob G.: chat, this is getting off topic
42:58 | Stray Wolf: but it would be best with a bilingual vtuber 
43:00 | TheCanti: If you do want to talk to Dads, I would just say to have it with just a few Trusted dads.
43:03 | Stray Wolf: maybe? 
43:03 | 77Yuja_: nono
43:04 | TentacleTimeEternal -: Koopa would be a good option
43:08 | rashef: Yet? So you're saying there's a chance...
43:09 | Big Ron: Based boomer bear
43:19 | Monkberry Moon: A few small chuubas from certain imageboards might be willing to help
43:21 | pakkanen: Beatani, Your viewers can setup Discord for you and send invitation via Twitter if needed
43:22 | BasedBug: Playing games with dads would be fun
43:26 | monkeynohito: Oh yeah, she is allowed to collab with Koopa.
43:34 | max r: Community game, 
43:36 | ThePlatinumCan: Hmmmm
43:37 | max r: watchalong
43:38 | knull: Fight club watch along?
43:46 | Firstname Lastname: FLCL live watch?
43:46 | Idle Bear: Movie watch along can be fun
43:48 | Kemonomimi: watchalongs are easy
43:50 | Δ: we can do a skype sesh 
43:51 | Megiddo: can do a FLCL watchalong
43:52 | MBmasher: karaoke?
43:53 | TheCanti: Yea, games that dads can join in with, Zatsudans, and watchalongs are good staples
43:54 | Rob G.: Fight club lol
43:55 | kevzor: koopa more like poopa because she's shit
43:56 | Monkberry Moon: watchalongs, collab games
43:58 | Hanabi: playing with dads sounds fun, letting them on VC seems like a yabai moment waiting to happen
44:02 | ThePlatinumCan: Anime and movie watchalong
44:03 | 77Yuja_: horror movi
44:04 | TentacleTimeEternal -: >2021 >using skype
44:06 | CantDood: watchalongs sounds like a good idea to try
44:07 | BasedBug: I can be selfish and say Halo Custom Games
44:13 | Shippo: never seen fight club so i'd love to see it with the bear
44:20 | CommanderMichael: i would go with movie watchalongs
44:20 | Absolute Link: depending on the game, you could stream publicly but invite only members to play
44:20 | Stray Wolf: Super Bunny Man is always fun 
44:21 | Rob G.: Bladerunner 😞 
44:22 | Steven Frati: Monthly emote design and planning members only stream!
44:26 | Jackku Chan: Watchalongs make me fall asleep....
44:28 | Megiddo: sorry bug but she doesn't like fps
44:28 | 123457474869: retro super mario?
44:39 | Flux: Based
44:40 | max r: its fine to do games like among us without voice chat , yeah that's fine.
44:44 | Rye Mountain: Among us was very popular for membership streams before but among us is not popular anymore
44:45 | Mister Eko: Bladerunner bros...
44:45 | Lamb San: based
44:55 | BasedBug: @Megiddo Yeah, it'll stay a dream
44:58 | Monkberry Moon: lol
44:59 | Rob G.: relatable
45:03 | Δ: sus
45:04 | Nasty Yukari: Basedrunner
45:08 | max r: i thought among us is fun for streams with community, even if it's not popular
45:10 | 77Yuja_: phantasy star
45:12 | Megiddo: first person shooter. Like PUBG
45:13 | Stray Wolf: FPS (first person shooter) 
45:13 | pakkanen: FPS = First Person Shooter or Frames Per Second
45:14 | Rob G.: good, no Apex tortures
45:14 | Mister Eko: first person shooter games
45:14 | Suukotto Funsha: fps = first person shooter
45:18 | imalittle cupcake: One of those "draw a word and others guess what the drawing is" games would be good
45:18 | TheCanti: Shoot people game
45:20 | TheCanti: Bang bang
45:22 | BasedBug: @77Yuja_ MY MAN PSO IS GREAT
45:22 | Absolute Link: yes exactly
45:24 | Mew: Yeah you don't have to play that
45:31 | Hanabi: 100% Orange Juice is a pretty fun online party game on PC. Like Mario Party but with characters from shmup games
45:34 | Mew: She doesn't get the appeal
45:36 | Jackku Chan: You WILL play Apex.
45:38 | 123457474869: FPS = free porcupine spines
45:43 | TheCanti: Oh 100% orange juice is a good choice
45:44 | D. D.: spurdo? lol
45:45 | Megiddo: no pls. no apex
45:49 | Peer: no apex, pls
45:50 | TheCanti: I can second that
45:55 | pakkanen: Doom is good example of FPS game
45:59 | Mechanized Doge: en: she knows what an fps game is, but do not understand what's going on on the screen itself
46:01 | Mew: You could try Monhun rise
46:03 | Antonio Badilla: Fighting games would be cool.
46:14 | CantDood: if it's the first time you'll play any FPS it will be REALLY hard the first tries
46:20 | Peer: but unreal tournament '99 on another hand...
46:25 | Rye Mountain: I think FPS streams are very boring
46:26 | TentacleTimeEternal -: monster hunter rise?
46:28 | monkeynohito: 100% orange juice is cheap too
46:29 | Absolute Link: lol
46:30 | rashef: Let's play Super Animal Royale. it's fun.
46:31 | Lamb San: Beatani do you like RTS games?
46:32 | Megiddo: yup, sounds like a fps
46:34 | Tachi: FPS are not based
46:35 | D3bugged: Beatani do you play Monster Hunter?
46:38 | Stray Wolf: She doesn't have a switch yet so no MHR
46:38 | RueTobas: 100% Orange juice is a great idea
46:39 | monkeynohito: Among Us is also cheap
46:41 | max r: i don't personally like fps , but many friends play it... i think CoD Zombies looks fun.
46:41 | Peer: 1000% orange juice is based
46:45 | 123457474869: how about CHESS? lol
46:46 | Rob G.: good, FPS are crap
46:47 | Δ: sus
46:53 | Megiddo: @Lamb San RTS games are nonexistent in Japan
46:55 | Δ: chess would be great
46:55 | Mechanized Doge: pakkanenさんがオススメしたゲーム、「DOOM」はオススメです
46:55 | Shippo: play Super Animal Royale, it's battle royale but with animals and cute
46:55 | BasedBug: Never play a Battle Royale
46:55 | Mew: What is your favorite type of game? If it's slay the spire there is a lot of similar ones
47:00 | TentacleTimeEternal -: Beatani Nintendo Switch Fund project GO
47:01 | Destoroyar Fortress: I sometimes get dizzy watching FPS
47:02 | TheCanti: Yea 100% Orange juice and Among us are inexpensive and good games for streamers with members
47:03 | ThePlatinumCan: Chaotic in multiplayer matches
47:09 | CommanderMichael: ah I see, FPS are too fast paced for her
47:11 | Mew: If you never played it it's really difficult
47:21 | Mew: DOOM is very old school
47:25 | Mew: and single player
47:25 | BasedBug: The Kuma Slayer
47:26 | Jackku Chan: Party games would be good, yeah.
47:30 | Hanabi: DOOM is a classic
47:31 | Flux: 100% orange juice
47:43 | CommanderMichael: she might have never played shooter games, so FPS might overwhelm her
47:49 | Mister Eko: What about Superhot? It's slowpaced 
47:50 | Mew: You can try old doom, like Korone did 
47:52 | Megiddo: challenged
47:53 | Jackku Chan: Challenged
47:53 | Absolute Link: challenged
47:55 | Hanabi: challenged?
47:55 | Sheep: lol
47:57 | 123457474869: directionally challenged
47:57 | Ark K.: ohadayoo
47:58 | Transcendental_ColonThree: Challenged?
48:00 | クラガリ葉月: Challenged
48:00 | Noon C.: challenged
48:00 | rashef: challenged
48:00 | max r: like jackbox ?
48:00 | ThePlatinumCan: Directionally challanged
48:01 | Mechanized Doge: イージーモードで遊べいいよ。簡単ぽいゲームだよ。
48:02 | monkeynohito: jackbox games would be fun, but they could get pretty yab on the word games.
48:03 | CantDood: lmao
48:03 | TentacleTimeEternal -: what game genre has she played?
48:06 | Stray Wolf: it's okay 
48:10 | imalittle cupcake: 100% Orange Juice would be really fun game
48:16 | ellescer: Lol
48:19 | Steven Frati: What kind of games do beatani enjoy?
48:19 | Monkberry Moon: beatani...
48:25 | Stray Wolf: many vtubers are directionally challenged 
48:28 | ThatVidyaGuy: Thats just a part of the fun!
48:31 | Mister Eko: yah
48:31 | Shippo: yeah, orange juice would be great
48:32 | Megiddo: wakaru
48:37 | Jackku Chan: It's okay to be directionally challenged if you never leave your room!
48:43 | CantDood: don't play metroidvanias
48:43 | max r: i like jackbox and among us, i know some ppl also said orange juice is fun
48:44 | Suukotto Funsha: It's fine if you get lost, the adventure is part of the fun
48:44 | Shippo: i'd also say try jackbox but that could end bad
48:48 | Mew: Monster Hunter rise with light bow gun is an FPS right?
48:51 | Lamb San: this bear is lost...
48:54 | TheCanti: <-- Left Right -->
48:55 | Jackku Chan: Haha, good joke Beatani!
48:57 | CantDood: I get lost every 5 mins in them too
48:58 | BasedBug: Jackbox drawing games would be kino
49:03 | Sheep: CUTE!!
49:07 | Noon C.: left is back. right is foward
49:12 | Mew: >>>- Hidari? >><<< Migi?
49:14 | pakkanen: Space Channel 5 - Left, Right, Left, Right, Sho, Sho SHo!
49:16 | Canna: You can make an L with your left hand. Pointer finger and thumb. 
49:16 | Mister Eko: left side right side!
49:17 | Stray Wolf: Beatani: no sense of right or left
49:18 | クラガリ葉月: 上下
49:24 | Stray Wolf: YOU ARE KING 
49:26 | TheCanti: Yea Drawful could also be good, though it might be hard for Beatani
49:27 | RueTobas: beatani king cover when
49:27 | Suukotto Funsha: Hidari = Left Migi = Right
49:28 | Jackku Chan: Left is East Right is West it's that easy.
49:31 | BasedBug: 左？？右？？？
49:33 | Mister Eko: yeah, don't worry
49:34 | Rob G.: hmm spacial perception/memory. It depends on genes and sex
49:39 | Joestar: We can understand 
49:41 | Δ: @Stray Wolf holy kek
49:49 | Joestar: Just look at your hands
49:56 | Joestar: Left hand is L shape
49:58 | Mew: Hidari is clearly North 
50:04 | クラガリ葉月: 前裏
50:04 | Defenestrator: old brain
50:06 | Peer: left and right is like west and east
50:15 | Mew: 右は南東です 
50:22 | Δ: Ate fps 
50:27 | クラガリ葉月: You're on XP hill
50:41 | TentacleTimeEternal -: do you play snes game?
50:41 | imalittle cupcake: Cute...
50:42 | Tachi: Minecraft too hard
50:43 | bulletfodder: where is bear?
50:46 | RueTobas: That's how she got lost on the internet
50:51 | Δ: ye
50:52 | Kazoo: minesweeper?
50:55 | Noon C.: did she get lost already?
51:02 | Suukotto Funsha: The hand trick works well, Hold both out and the one that makes an L is left, the reverse L is right
51:04 | Lamb San: this is how she ended up on /vt/
51:05 | gyroninja: Here is here
51:06 | Monkberry Moon: Ah that happens a lot 
51:08 | Rob G.: yeah I understand, but can't relate. Sorry.
51:08 | Sheep: YAB
51:10 | CommanderMichael: ah I see, in a 3D game where there's any form of exploration, she tends to get lost
51:12 | Lamb San: she got lost
51:17 | BasedBug: Uh oh

51:21 | Peer: thath and that, there and there

51:32 | クラガリ葉月: Thank you options menu
51:37 | TentacleTimeEternal -: menu visible
51:41 | Eric Muller: you should look up "poor sense of direction rap"
51:43 | Mister Eko: ah... the first yab... she has grown so fast...
51:43 | Lamb San: your settings

1:02:54 | Megiddo: no bathroom?
1:02:55 | Mechanized Doge: my relatives over in Japan are moving to Chiba eventually since owning a house or rent there is far cheaper than Tokyo.
1:02:56 | Mister Eko: That rent for a single room apartment is insanely pricey in my country 
1:02:57 | Megiddo: kusa
1:03:00 | RueTobas: @LassesAffar that's crazy expensive

1:03:37 | Steven Frati: 400 member goal is doable!
1:03:46 | Megiddo: the utility cost seems super high unless that includes water/internet/trash etc
1:03:57 | Mew: Well Tokyo is really about where you live
1:03:58 | RueTobas: also electricity costs seem pretty high too tbh
1:04:17 | Mechanized Doge: @123457474869 that's only if you live in Downtown Toronto or big cities, no? Up north is far cheaper.
1:04:21 | Mew: You can get 2DK of 40m^2 if you're okay living in nishi tokyo and 20 minutes walk from the train station
1:04:25 | Monster hmc: small
1:04:28 | Jackku Chan: Japan has garbage insulation so a lot of energy is wasted in heating efficiency
1:04:29 | Megiddo: I pay about 8000 yen for power/heat
1:04:30 | BasedBug: That is so small..
1:04:34 | Mister Eko: holy shit, 20m2?
