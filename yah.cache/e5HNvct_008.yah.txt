25:15 | hustler one: 1fps
25:17 | StrangerSeen: Do you want the answer?
25:18 | Sunspots: probably need a weapon
25:25 | GrassHopperMouse: Does the game look fine for you? the stream is lagging for us.
25:34 | EryQ53: He's in this kind of pain that alcohol won't cure
25:38 | Mew: Poor bears laptop is melting

28:09 | Vitz: Oh no
28:15 | Transcendental_ColonThree: oh no . w.
28:33 | mikkis: use board as weapon?
28:39 | Mew: Click and hold on the dog
28:42 | Mew: maybe then
28:50 | Hertan: Maybe add chat rules to the description?
29:00 | LoneRanger25: board seems like it should work
29:00 | yuuyuu: Beatani is figuring it out
29:01 | Kaiser Kebab: You can always kill it later, you should explore the area first
29:21 | LoneRanger25: Guess not RIP
29:59 | EryQ53: Look for a weapon around the house
30:03 | Mew: eating wood sasuga polish people
30:19 | LoneRanger25: I think the game wants you to use something different that you have to find
30:20 | GrassHopperMouse: maybe the board is not the solution
30:25 | (Verified, Moderator) Nightbot: zzzzzz
30:58 | yuuyuu: exploring forest with Beatani
30:58 | GrassHopperMouse: maybe go over the fence out front?
31:01 | StrangerSeen: Weapon is much more obvious than board.
31:11 | GrassHopperMouse: you can climb over the fence with [space]
31:13 | Apu 2: strong bear, king of the forest
32:12 | GrassHopperMouse: the fence in front of the dog
32:16 | LoneRanger25: We're enjoying it too. The dog, not so much
32:25 | Apu 2: on the right
32:36 | Chloro [クロロ]: Nice!
32:51 | Theblekedet: Here we go!
32:54 | LoneRanger25: Now you can axe the dog a question
33:18 | Mew: Hotbar is the thing to the left
33:23 | Mew: where you ahve 1 2 3
33:26 | GrassHopperMouse: I think you need to select the axe in your hotbar, (the numbers to the side), so you probably need to drag the axe into one of those spaces.
33:33 | Mew: So place the axe there
34:24 | GrassHopperMouse: your axe is in your inventory, try opening your inventory and drag the axe onto the hotbar
34:37 | Mew: No, Hotbar is a shortcut for your inventory
34:42 | GrassHopperMouse: Do you remember how to open inventory?
34:45 | Mew: You can have many things in the inventory
34:58 | Sunspots: TAB button if i recall correctly
35:10 | Sunspots: TAB to open inventory i think
35:15 | GrassHopperMouse: [TAB]
35:17 | Mew: TAB
35:39 | Apu 2: strong bear
36:03 | Sunspots: strong bear, weak doggo
36:06 | Kaiser Kebab: 3fps bear

36:47 | Marc Bradford: F
36:49 | Mew: :thanksdoc:
36:49 | Transcendental_ColonThree: F
36:51 | GrassHopperMouse: What are your PC specs?

37:18 | Hertan: KSZK internet
37:22 | Mew: Are you on laptop? Is it hot?
37:25 | ThePlatinumCan: KSZK
37:27 | Apu 2: wel lthat explains everything
37:33 | GrassHopperMouse: I think it's the PC rather than internet, because we have no lag when you're inside the house
37:34 | LoneRanger25: Comcast JP lol
37:36 | Apu 2: internet in the buckets 
37:37 | yuuyuu: don't worry Beatani
37:40 | Chloro [クロロ]: it's probably internet problem, don't mind too much though
37:41 | SkysNotTheLimit: Keep playing!
37:44 | Kyle: We can hear your voice clearly, it's just the video that is breaking up
37:45 | Sunspots: its the internet lads not the computer
37:45 | Mew: Bad internet 😭
37:53 | Peer: I think its not your internet we can hear you perfectly
38:02 | Orange Princess: internet not a strong bear
38:05 | GrassHopperMouse: If it was internet problem we wouldn't hear her well, but we do
38:13 | Outwith: Depending on what software you are using to stream it might be worth turning down the bitrate?
38:20 | Transcendental_ColonThree: yes
38:23 | Arthur C.:  No one is safe from bad internet:buffering:
38:28 | Theblekedet: and your audio is clear
38:36 | MonquSurtonpif: Too much cute and funny downloads.
38:49 | Peer: no buffering on my bear isp btw
38:58 | Transcendental_ColonThree: If it's laptop with dedicated small GPU it might be it fault
39:00 | LoneRanger25: You can try playing the game in windowed mode instead of fullscreen
39:02 | StrangerSeen: What is bears bitrate?

2:11:44 | O5060403: 草
2:11:45 | Chloro [クロロ]: What was that!?
2:11:45 | Vitz: what is happening
2:11:47 | Stray Wolf: F 
2:11:48 | .sandrio: F
2:11:48 | Arcterion: Devoured by a wild fart.
2:11:52 | StrangerSeen: you will die if you stay out at night
2:11:55 | Sprongle: F
2:11:58 | SkysNotTheLimit: F
2:12:01 | Sunspots: this forest is dangerous
2:12:03 | SuppahTenko: You cannot be out at night
2:12:10 | Outwith: R.I.P
2:12:18 | Heretic: F
2:12:25 | .sandrio: @Chloro [クロロ] the lore is that the house is filled with smoke that repels whatever kills you outside at night
2:12:32 | StrangerSeen: F
2:12:41 | Vitz: Looks like Poland all right
2:12:51 | .sandrio: basically at night the game turns into home defense simulator
2:12:58 | Sunspots: Poland is hell
2:13:14 | SuppahTenko: Generator has enough fuel for the first night
2:13:26 | cynops: krowky. flushed
2:13:28 | Nero: Don't waste your fuel
2:13:33 | Chloro [クロロ]: That sounds like a pain in the ass
2:13:38 | Nero: You should turn that back off
2:13:43 | Qwazola: Is it really supposed to be in Poland because man does it scream Eastern Europe
2:13:54 | SuppahTenko: Only have the generator on when you need it.
2:14:04 | Ikxi: music sounds like "Sound of Silence" lul
2:14:09 | SuppahTenko: Poland is eastern europe
2:14:11 | Meneltir: It is set in Poland, yes.
2:14:22 | yuuyuu: 🐻🐻🐻
2:15:06 | Qwazola: Incredible, they really did a good job with the setting then
2:15:12 | (Verified, Moderator) Nightbot: zzzzzz
2:15:15 | Meneltir: Might be Second Republic, when it was under strong Soviet influence - there's lots of old technology and some of the spelling is a bit weird.
2:15:38 | Viking: Fkn Polan (vomiting)
2:15:43 | SuppahTenko: Theres also another person to talk to
2:15:54 | SuppahTenko: You can trade with them.
2:16:10 | cynops: polan:
2:16:14 | SuppahTenko: Same spot as the wolf last time
2:16:23 | Jackku Chan: In hideout
2:17:30 | SkysNotTheLimit: Typical Polish man
2:18:49 | Nixo: dark hood
2:19:08 | Qwazola: dak ood
2:19:23 | SkysNotTheLimit: He has guns too, wow
2:19:33 | Adlan Haris Animet: Hello you are Cute😊😊💞
2:19:40 | SuppahTenko: reputation is the currency
2:20:05 | SkysNotTheLimit: More window shopping
2:20:28 | Adlan Haris Animet: how often do you stream?
2:20:36 | SuppahTenko: Thats also just the frame, don't think about getting guns for now
2:20:47 | Nero: Oh yeah, she hasn't put her mushrooms in the thing yet
2:20:52 | SuppahTenko: You get 50 reputation each night you survive too
2:20:53 | Qwazola: Looks like a Liberator, noice
2:21:12 | Adlan Haris Animet: Angel Voice😇😇😇
2:21:13 | Sunspots: you can cook the mushrooms in the saferoom where the gas/smoke is
2:21:18 | SkysNotTheLimit: Can boards be used as weapons?
2:21:30 | Shuko: I can't stay awake for the rest of the stream I think. Goodnight Beatani, stay cute and funny
2:21:42 | hustler one: what are batteries used for in this game
2:21:51 | O5060403: Dangarous egg
2:21:57 | Nero: I think boards can be used to make a weapon when you combine them with nails
2:21:58 | SuppahTenko: On the ground sometimes are spots of mushrooms you can pickup. Pay attention to objects on the ground.
2:22:04 | O5060403: Dangerous*
2:22:43 | Chloro [クロロ]: Maybe you can add the axe blade on the board to make an axe?
2:22:44 | SuppahTenko: Outside is a pile of wood you can turn into boards in the wood chipper
2:23:28 | Kaiser Kebab: Axe head is expensive
2:23:30 | SuppahTenko: On the left
2:23:37 | SuppahTenko: Next to the door
2:24:14 | SkysNotTheLimit: I like this BGM
2:24:47 | SuppahTenko: Outside the house against the wall
2:25:03 | Nero: He leaves when you leave the meadow
2:25:07 | Chloro [クロロ]: wolf-san is gone?
2:25:32 | SuppahTenko: Top left of your scree currently
2:27:08 | yuuyuu: naisu
2:27:23 | O5060403: Mushrooms are very tasty.
2:27:39 | SuppahTenko: Like 2 centimeters left of where you found the mushroom
2:27:44 | SkysNotTheLimit: Fried kinoko?
2:27:51 | GrassHopperMouse: Oh, it's the "breaking bad" sort of cook
2:29:11 | Nero: Just above the open door honey
2:29:34 | .sandrio: Yeah the protag doesnt need food or sleep anymore, everything in the forest is mutated
2:29:36 | major wow: outside the door
2:30:13 | (Verified, Moderator) Nightbot: zzzzzz
2:30:25 | SuppahTenko: This is going to be difficult
2:30:44 | (Verified, Moderator) Nightbot: @Nimue Albon -> You are the missing link. Goodbye. [stop spamming caps] [warning]
2:30:47 | Nero: I gotta account for the time lag between seeing what you do and when I write the comment. But he's talking about the exit door on the left side of the house.
2:30:55 | SkysNotTheLimit: Hahahahaha
2:30:55 | .sandrio: haha
2:31:28 | SkysNotTheLimit: She can break stuff in the safehouse for materials, right?
2:32:15 | major wow: outside the door by the mushrooms
2:32:32 | .sandrio: Yeah, i think you can break furniture
2:32:50 | major wow: right there
2:32:55 | SukiKirai: now that's a based game
2:32:56 | SkysNotTheLimit: Nice!
2:33:06 | Chloro [クロロ]: Ooh, nice!
2:33:08 | SkysNotTheLimit: It's empty?
2:33:17 | SkysNotTheLimit: There are no logs in the log pile?
2:33:17 | SuppahTenko: None in there, thats bad luck.
2:33:22 | major wow: ah sorry
2:33:31 | SkysNotTheLimit: Try breaking some furniture
2:33:36 | .sandrio: Its hard to tell what you can interact with in this game, sadly
2:34:02 | SuppahTenko: There was also wood to the left on the way to the burned house
2:34:08 | Chloro [クロロ]: Is there only one wood logs? tough luck
2:34:46 | SuppahTenko: You can see on the map spots with wood
2:35:16 | yuuyuu: ogey
2:35:17 | SkysNotTheLimit: Wood pile!
2:35:22 | .sandrio: rrat
2:35:25 | SkysNotTheLimit: Right side of house, I think
2:35:33 | SuppahTenko: Burned house also has some wood spots
2:35:34 | yuuyuu: 草
2:35:36 | ThePlatinumCan: Oof
2:35:38 | Ark K.: oh no
2:35:39 | major wow: run!
2:35:48 | Ukitsu2: I don't like those kind of dogs.

2:36:28 | Sunspots: two dogs こわ
2:36:38 | Eika: そのゲーはむずかしそう！
2:36:50 | SuppahTenko: Some items are lost when you die
2:37:00 | O5060403: This game has a lot of hard English words, doesn't it?
2:37:17 | SkysNotTheLimit: So many dogs in this forest
2:37:33 | Viking: Kill doggo
2:37:41 | Ark K.: so many dogs
2:37:44 | Chloro [クロロ]: dog is zurui dayo!
2:37:53 | Nero: She doesn't have any weapons
2:38:08 | Viking: pain
2:38:21 | SuppahTenko: Later in the game there will be beartraps in the woods, so it's important to pay close attention where you walk.
2:38:22 | Marc Bradford: Wao!
2:38:24 | Ukitsu2: A shotgun would be nice.
2:38:26 | SkysNotTheLimit: Pain kuma
2:39:01 | Ark K.: is the game hard?
2:39:08 | SuppahTenko: Chain trap holds enemies in place.
2:39:48 | SkysNotTheLimit: Darkwood is Based, confirmed

2:41:27 | SuppahTenko: That yes
2:41:35 | .sandrio: yes!
2:41:48 | Chloro [クロロ]: Yeah, maybe it's better to hide for now
2:42:06 | SuppahTenko: You need to turn the generator on before night, then stand next to a lamp and be scared.
2:42:12 | SkysNotTheLimit: Turn on the generator at night, be careful bear
2:42:13 | Sunspots: remember to turn on the generator
2:42:46 | Nero: To your right
2:42:52 | SuppahTenko: Tiny building on the right
2:43:13 | Nero: In the room on your right
2:43:29 | major wow: naisu

2:44:30 | 玲: こんばんは！
2:44:34 | Nero: You should close all the doors
2:44:43 | SkysNotTheLimit: Can you break some furniture and get materials?
2:44:58 | .sandrio: at night even the hideout is dangerous
2:45:06 | Sunspots: cute singing
2:45:13 | (Verified, Moderator) Nightbot: zzzzzz
2:45:34 | SuppahTenko: No, you can break the furniture with weapons, but you don't get stuff from it
2:45:38 | Mothman: hello night bot
2:46:11 | SkysNotTheLimit: Scary noises
2:46:25 | SkysNotTheLimit: 1000 subscriber karaoke time?
2:46:28 | SuppahTenko: First night is relatively quiet
2:46:35 | Qwazola: Hell yeah!
2:46:41 | Nero: Can you move the container below you to cover the hole in the room?
2:46:48 | SuppahTenko: That will not be the case for other nights.
2:46:57 | SuppahTenko: yes
2:47:38 | SuppahTenko: You cannot barricade all spots so you have to place furniture in way sometimes.
2:47:45 | Chloro [クロロ]: Lamp-kun helps bear to calm down
2:47:47 | Arcterion: Turn it off just to see what happens. Science!
2:47:51 | Leyva Diaz Alejandro Ivan: the light wont last forever
2:47:55 | SuppahTenko: Close to morning
2:48:03 | .sandrio: brace for the crescendo

2:49:51 | Kaiser Kebab: buy some boards 
2:50:02 | SuppahTenko: Boards, fuel maybe
2:50:26 | SkysNotTheLimit: Gasoline, right
2:50:27 | .sandrio: having a board with nails would help against the dogs, then exploration is easiert
2:51:11 | Izumi Ziahn: easier*
2:51:48 | .sandrio: oops, my bad, typo
2:51:49 | SuppahTenko: You can make a weapon at the workbench.
